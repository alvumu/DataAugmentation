Clinical notes
"A 35-year-old male patient with a tumour in the upper pole of the right testicle found by chance during self-exploration, for which reason he attended a urology consultation where a physical examination was performed, revealing a mass of approximately 1cm in diameter depending on the epididymis, and a testicular ultrasound scan, which was reported as a solid nodular lesion in the head of the right epididymis. MRI was performed. Confirming nodular mass, with adenomatoid tumour of the epididymis being the first diagnostic possibility.  It was decided, in both cases, to surgically resect the nodular tumour in the right epididymal tail, without performing a subsequent orchiectomy. In both cases an anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimen was performed. Macroscopic histological findings: nodular formation of 1.5 cm (case 1) and 1.2 cm (case 2) of firm consistency, whitish colour and well demarcated. Microscopically, tumour proliferation was observed, consisting of tubular structures in which the cellularity showed rounded and elongated nuclei without cytological atypia and occasionally showed vacuolated cytoplasm, all compatible with adenomatoid tumour of the epididymis.

"Two newborns, male and female from the same mother, died at 10 and 45 minutes of life respectively, and underwent post-mortem examination. The first of the corpses, corresponding to the female, was referred with the clinical judgement of severe respiratory failure with suspected Potter's Syndrome and severe oligohydramnios; she was born by emergency caesarean section due to breech presentation and the Apgar test was 1/3/7; minutes later she died. External examination revealed a subcyanotic colour, triangular facies with mongoloid parpebral fissures, micrognathia, broad nasal root and prominent occiput. The abdomen, globular, hard and slightly dented, allowed the palpation of two large masses occupying both renal fossae and hemiabdomenes. When the cavities were opened, the presence of two large renal masses measuring 10 x 8 x 5.5 cm and 12 x 8 x 6 cm with weights of 190 and 235 g respectively, stood out. Although the renal silhouette could be discerned, the surface, dented, showed numerous cystic formations of serous content; when cut, these cysts were heterogeneous in size, with those located at the cortical level being larger, giving the kidney a sponge-like appearance. The right and left lungs weighed 17 and 15 grams (usual weight of the set of 49 grams) showing a uniform reddish hue; both were compressed as a result of the diaphragmatic elevation conditioned by the large size of the kidneys. The rest of the organs showed no significant macroscopic alterations except for the positional alterations derived from the renal compression. In the second carcass, the male, similar morphological changes were observed, although the size of the kidneys was even larger, with weights of 300 and 310 grams. The rest of the abdominal viscera were compressed against the diaphragm. In both cases, a detailed histological study was performed, focusing especially on the kidneys where multiple cysts of different sizes with saccular morphology were demonstrated at the cortical level. These cysts occupied most of the corticomedullary parenchyma, although the preserved areas showed no significant alterations except for focal immaturity. These cysts were lined by a simple epithelium varying from flat to cubic. The smaller, more rounded medullary cysts were lined by a predominantly cubic epithelium. After the renal cysts, the most striking alterations were found in the liver where proliferation and dilatation, even cystic, of the bile ducts at the level of the portal spaces were observed. These findings led to a diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in both cases.   "
"A 64-year-old patient, allergic to penicillin and with aortic valve replacement due to endocarditis, consulted for the appearance of a penile mass of progressive growth in recent weeks. Physical examination revealed an excrescent and variegated formation on the glans penis, which deformed the meatus, with ulcerated areas covered with fibrin. Hard, fixed lymph nodes were palpable in both inguinal regions. Chest X-ray and abdomino-pelvic CT confirmed the presence of large pulmonary and inguinal adenopathies. With the diagnosis of penile neoplasia, partial penectomy with safety margin was performed. Pathological anatomy showed a pleomorphic penile sarcoma with osteosarcomatous differentiation and margins free of involvement. Treatment with two lines of chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin and ifosfamide was decided but there was no response. He was admitted again with a large and rapidly growing local bleeding recurrence that caused obstruction of the meatus with acute renal failure. A cystostomy tube was placed and treatment with serum therapy was started, improving renal function, but with progressive worsening of the general condition until he died 6 months after diagnosis.   "
"A 28-year-old woman with no previous history of interest consulted for voiding syndrome with predominantly daytime frequency of urinary frequency and a certain degree of urgency without urinary leakage. Urine culture was negative and treatment with anticholinergics was indicated. Given the lack of response to treatment, cystography was performed, which was normal, and renovesical ultrasound showed cystic parapipelic images, some of them with internal septa and bladder without lesions. In order to determine the nature of these cysts, an abdominal CT scan was requested, which revealed a large parapelvic cyst in the right kidney with no repercussions on the duct and a right adrenal hypodense mass. MRI showed a normal adrenal gland and a lobulated cystic lesion containing numerous septa in its interior surrounding the right kidney; in the left renal cell there was a lesion of similar characteristics but smaller in size. The findings were compatible with bilateral renal lymphangioma. After three years of follow-up the patient continues with mild micturition symptomatology under treatment, but has not presented symptoms derived from her renal lesion.   "
"A 68-year-old man, with a history of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to aspirin and transient ischaemic accident under chronic treatment with trifusal (300 mg every 12 hours), attended the emergency department of the Hospital San Agustín (Avilés, Asturias) in May 2006, due to intense, continuous, sudden onset pain in the left hemiabdomen accompanied by vegetative crusade. On examination, blood pressure was 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate 80 per minute, and pain in the left iliac fossa, accentuated by palpation. The blood count (haemoglobin: 13 g/dL, platelets: 249,000), coagulation study, elementary blood biochemistry, urine system, electrocardiogram and simple chest X-ray were normal. The abdominal CT scan showed an extensive haematoma, 12 cm in maximum diameter, in the left renal cell, with no free intraperitoneal fluid; the left adrenal gland was engulfed and could not be identified, and the right adrenal gland was unchanged. The AHT was not controlled in the ED, despite treatment with analgesics, calcium antagonists and angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitors, so the patient, who maintained blood pressure levels of 240/160 mm Hg, was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for intravenous treatment with nitroprusside and labetalol. In the following 24 hours, the hypertensive crisis was jugulated, and haemoglobin and haematocrit were found to remain stable.  With the diagnostic suspicion of non-traumatic rupture of a pre-existing pheochromocytoma, plasma metanephrines were determined, which were normal, and urinary catecholamines and metanephrines. In the 24-hour urine of the day after admission, the following results were obtained: adrenaline: 65.1 mcg (normal values - VN: 1.7-22.5), noradrenaline: 151.1 mcg (VN: 12.1-85.5), metanephrine: 853.5 mcg (VN: 74-297) and normetanephrine: 1396.6 mcg (VN: 105-354). After 10 days, while the patient was still in hospital, the urinary figures had completely normalised spontaneously. As for the haematoma, in July 2006 it had not been reabsorbed and a pseudocystic image persisted in the left adrenal area. A unilateral adrenalectomy was performed in September 2006, and histological examination showed an encapsulated mass measuring 6 x 5 cm, with extensive haemorrhagic necrosis and some cortical cells without atypia.   "
"We present the case of a three-day-old newborn, who came to the emergency department with his mother because of an enlargement of the left hemiscrotal and a purplish colour; the newborn was well at birth according to the parents, and in the last four hours he had been crying inconsolably. There was no fever or other clinical findings. On examination there was an enlarged left hemiscrotal, painful on manipulation, and wine-red in colour. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities in the haemogram, biochemistry or coagulation studies. Scrotal ultrasound showed a normal right testicle; the left testicle was found to be enlarged, with irregularities in its interior, with an anechoic area that may suggest necrosis, surrounded by a hyperechoic area suggestive of calcification; all of this was compatible with advanced testicular torsion.  The patient underwent surgery and the left testicle was removed and the right testicle was fixed, evolving favourably and two years later he was well and the right testicle was normal in size and consistency.   "
"A 58-year-old woman was seen by the gastrointestinal department for pain in the right hypochondrium of 6 months' duration, accompanied by alterations in bowel habits. She had no general syndrome or urological symptoms. Physical examination revealed a good general state of health, normal hydration, normal colour and moderate obesity. There is no cushingoid habitus or stigmata of virilisation. Blood pressure is normal. Cardiopulmonary auscultation is normal. The abdomen was globular, soft and depressible, making palpation of possible masses or organomegaly difficult, showing slight pain on deep pressure in the right hypochondrium, with no Murphy's sign. As for the complementary examinations, the routine biochemical and haematological analysis, as well as the adrenal function tests were within normal ranges. Ultrasonography shows the presence of a tumour in the right adrenal area measuring approximately 6x6 cm. No liver metastases are observed. The CT scan confirms the mass in close contact with the wall of the inferior vena cava, which it apparently displaces, and infiltration of the latter cannot be ruled out. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal lymph node involvement or metastasis elsewhere. There was also no evidence of tumour thrombosis. In view of these findings, it was decided to perform MRI for a correct definition of the involvement of neighbouring tissues, reporting identical CT findings and without being able to definitively predict parietal infiltration.  With the diagnosis of an adrenal mass, the decision was made to intervene, which was carried out through a transperitoneal right subcostal incision. The right adrenal region was approached, revealing a large tumour at this level. Dissection of the tumour was begun, but no plane of separation was found in the area of contact with the lateral and posterior wall of the vena cava, so it was decided to excise it after venous control proximal and distal to the mass and suturing with polypropylene of the wall of the inferior vena cava. The patient followed a favourable postoperative course, without developing complications. She was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. The macroscopic histological study showed a 6 x 8 cm piece of elastic consistency, easy to cut, with a fleshy appearance and greyish-brown colouring. Remains of adrenal tissue can be seen in the periphery, of apparently normal appearance. Microscopy reveals a proliferation of cellular elements of stromal lineage, with large pleomorphic nuclei, with multinucleated cells adopting a fascicular pattern. The mitotic index is high (7 m/10 high-magnification fields). There are areas of intratumoral necrosis and invasion of adrenal tissue present in the peripheral area. The definitive diagnosis is LEIOMIOSARCOMA OF CAVA. With regard to the evolution, both analytical and imaging tests performed in the early post-surgical period showed normality. The case was referred to the Oncology Department, which decided on consolidation radiotherapy treatment on the surgical site, which began 40 days after the operation. Further check-ups were carried out at six, nine, twelve and twenty-four months, all of which were normal.  The patient is currently alive and free of disease, after 28 months of follow-up.   "
"A 64-year-old man consulted in May 2006 for facial dysaesthesia and left palpebral ptosis and proptosis of the eyeball on the same side. Personal history of arterial hypertension under medical treatment, operated on for duodenal ulcus 20 years earlier, and laryngeal polyposis on two occasions in 1993 and 1994. Diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma by ultrasound biopsy in September 2005, with PSA of 794, alkaline phosphatase of 870, and bone scan showing multiple bone metastases. At that time, treatment was started with lh-rh analogues, flutamide and zoledronic acid 4 mg every 21 days for 6 months. The nadir PSA was reached in January 2006 at 36-17 ng/ml. Days before admission, he reported right facial numbness from the cheekbone to the upper lip, and simultaneously left palpebral ptosis together with ocular protrusion. There was no diplopia, facial or ocular pain. On physical examination, the patient was conscious, oriented and cooperative, presenting left palpebral ptosis with protrusion of the eye on the same side, with no apparent murmur, with paresis of the left third and sixth pairs. He also presented alterations in the sensitivity of the right half of the face, with the rest of the motor and sensory neurological examination being normal. Among the complementary tests, blood tests showed GGT of 86, alkaline phosphatase of 1145, and a PSA of 121-02. Brain MRI and angio MRI were performed, which showed supratentorial ischaemic lesions and an orbital mass of extraconal location attached to the left orbital roof that displaced and caudally engulfed the superior rectus muscle, while the left frontal sinus was occupied by a mass with the same characteristics as the one described. The superior orbital rim remains intact with no apparent signs of infiltration. The obliteration of the fat of the upper extraconal fat leads to inferior displacement and ocular proptosis. There is also an expansive mass located in the right maxillary sinus that breaks the lateral wall and extends towards the soft tissues, causing interruption of the floor of the right orbit and invasion of the inferior extraconal space, displacing the inferior rectus muscle without invading it. The cavernous sinuses were free.  The thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computerised axial tomography diagnosed a bony pattern with vertebral blast-lytic infiltration, without visceral alterations. Metastasis of prostatic adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the right maxillary sinus and left frontal sinus, with extraconal right inferior and left superior orbital involvement. Local radiotherapy was ruled out due to the risk of blindness. Flutamide was withdrawn as treatment, and the lh-rh analogue was maintained. In June 2006, treatment was started with docetaxel 70 mg/m2 every 21 days, together with prednisone 10 mg per day. Six cycles were completed by the end of September 2006. A nadir PSA level of 6-8 ng/mL was reached in July 2006, after the first two administrations of docetaxel. The patient reported a decrease in left ocular proptosis. Six cycles were completed, with excellent tolerance. In October 2006 the PSA was 149 ng/ml, with no change in the MRI images. Recently, in January 2007, treatment was restarted again with docetaxel and prednisone.   "
"We present the case of a 30-year-old woman, smoker of 20 cigarettes/day and with no other personal history of interest. The patient reported repeated urinary tract infections. An abdominal ultrasound scan was indicated and an intravesical nodular lesion was observed, for which she was referred to the urology department. Cystoscopy showed an exophytic tumour measuring 3x3 cm on the right lateral side with intact bladder mucosa, and no alterations were found in the rest of the bladder. Examination under anaesthesia (EBA) and transurethral resection of the lesion (TUR) were performed. The pathological anatomy report described macroscopically fragments of bladder wall with preserved urothelium without dysplasia, highlighting in the muscular layer itself and in continuity with the muscle tissue of the same, a spindle cell tumour with cells showing large nuclei, pleomorphic, vesicular in appearance and large eosinophilic cytoplasm. This cellularity is arranged in ill-defined fascicles and among it there is abundant cellularity consisting mainly of numerous plasma cells and eosinophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A high mitotic index is not observed, although the proliferation index measured as nuclear positivity with antibodies against MIB-1 is between 10 and 25% of the tumour cellularity. No areas of necrosis were observed. Immunohistochemistry showed marked positivity against cytokeratins (AE1/AE3) and CAM5.2 at the cytoplasmic level, as well as marked cytoplasmic positivity with antibodies against p80 (ALK protein). The cellularity described was negative for smooth muscle antibodies (smooth muscle actin, MyO D1 and Calretininin), as well as for CEA and high molecular weight cytokeratins, with only focal and isolated positivity for EMA. FISH on paraffin-embedded material showed no evidence of translocation in the ALK gene. The definitive anatomopathological diagnosis is inflammatory myofibroblastic bladder tumour.   "
"A 73-year-old male patient with a history of brucellosis, hyperuricaemia and hypercholesterolaemia was admitted to our department for scheduled surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia. In the diagnostic study, a rectal examination revealed a prostate with adenomatous characteristics, very enlarged (G III/IV). A retropubic adenomectomy was performed according to the T. Millin technique, enucleating a large adenoma weighing 170 grams. Six days later, the catheter was removed, the patient resumed comfortable urination and was discharged. Eleven days after the operation, and barely four days after discharge, the patient was readmitted to our department for abdominal pain (hypogastric), pain in the right testicle and thigh root on the same side, and a non-specific general malaise in the last 24 hours. A small amount of sero-purulent liquid drained from the orifice where the adenomectomy drainage was performed. The surgical wound was minimally impacted. He was admitted to the urology department with a diagnosis of surgical wound infection and empirical antibiotic treatment was started. The general and urological examination was within normal limits. Orchiepididymitis was ruled out. Laboratory tests showed a marked decrease in red blood count, but no leukocytosis. The patient is treated symptomatically but does not improve. The pain in the pubic area is accentuated, so bone scintigraphy is performed, which reports the finding of pathological hypercaptation of the radiotracer in the upper third of both pubis in relation to possible pubic osteopathy, as the only data of interest. The patient continues without improvement, the treatments (based on empirical antibiotherapy and analgesia) fail to reduce the pain, which is now located in the root of the thigh, and the general deterioration is accentuated. The patient presented severe anaemia, elevated ESR, fibrinogen and CRP. Examination of the thigh was unremarkable, with non-specific pain on pressure on the inner thigh. The pain was attributed to neurological involvement, as the examination was normal, and the pain also extended to the inguinal area and right testicle. With the diagnosis of a suspected pelvic abscess (the septic picture seemed unquestionable to us) in relation to the surgical history, an abdominal CT scan was requested. This showed absolute normality of the abdominal organs... but cuts made below the symphysis pubis at the level of the right thigh revealed a large abscess in the area of the adductor muscles. In view of this finding, the traumatology department was called in and noted that the inner aspect of the right thigh was now slightly reddened, swollen, painful on palpation but without clear fluctuation. The coxofemoral joint was free. Seven days after admission and as a matter of urgency, surgery was performed: a wide longitudinal incision was made on the inner side of the proximal third of the thigh and by means of blunt digital dissection, a deep penetration was made through the abductor musculature until a large purulent collection was reached, which was directed proximally towards the pubis. An abundance of foul-smelling pus is obtained (samples are taken for microbiological examination). After washing the cavity with abundant saline and oxygenated water, the surgical wound is partially closed and Penrose drains are left in place. Examination of the surgical wound of the adenomectomy and the area where the drain had been at the present time were absolutely normal and no cavities or collections were identified. Drains were placed and the operation was concluded. The patient required intensive care, transfusion of blood products, a long period of hospitalisation, meticulous local dressings, etc. The patient made a slow but excellent progress towards complete recovery. All subsequent controls (analytical, radiological, ultrasound...) corroborate the good evolution. The microbiology department informs us that the following results were obtained in the cultures taken: pure culture of seropurulent fluid from the adenomectomy wound: coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (without being able to specify the species). Culture of pus obtained during the operation to drain the thigh abscess: two strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus).   "
"A 23-year-old man consulted for a mass adjacent to the upper pole of the left teste, as a chance finding and in the absence of trauma or inflammatory symptoms. He had no history of testicular maldescension. On examination, the testicles were normal, with a 2 cm nodule, hard and painless in relation to the upper pole of the left testicle. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, with normal levels of germinal tumour markers. Ultrasonographically there was no hydrocele, the teste being normoechogenic and of normal size at around 35 mm in length, with a homogenous nodule of the same echogenicity as the testicle, 20 mm in size in relation to the head of the epididymis.  Surgical intervention was decided, during which a 2 cm large, well-defined, strikingly red mass was found, which was easily dissected from the upper pole of the testicle and epididymis, and the testicle was preserved.  Histologically it was diagnosed as splenic tissue without microscopic alterations, with preserved architecture and presence of white pulp with germinal centres, red pulp with venous sinuses and Billroth's cords.  At 16 months the patient is asymptomatic with a normal physical examination.   "
"A 54-year-old male patient with no personal history of interest. He attended the Emergency Department of our hospital in September 2005 due to right frontoparietal headache and lateral gaze diplopia of 2 weeks' duration, as well as right eyelid oedema for the last week. He was initially assessed by the Ophthalmology Department, which found moderate exophthalmos in the right eye, inflammation, hyperemia and moderate upper and lower right eyelid swelling, limitation in all gaze positions and diplopia. Visual acuity was not impaired. The intraocular pressure (IOP) of the right eye was 20 mmHg, the IOP of the left eye was 10 mmHg. Fundus examination was normal. An orbital CT scan was requested, showing an enlargement of the sphenoid bone with a permeative pattern and hyperostosis of the orbital face with a soft tissue mass bulging the lateral rectus muscle. There was also occupation of the ethmoid cells.  The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery department and a cranial MRI was requested, which was reported as a possible hyperostosis meningioma in the right periorbital plate of the greater wing of the sphenoid, without being able to rule out fibro-osseous sphenoid lesions. Surgical biopsy of these lesions was scheduled. The anatomopathological result of the biopsy was connective tissue, striated skeletal muscle and isolated bony trabeculae with nests and cords of epithelial cells with ample cytoplasm that focally formed glandular lumina, in the bone there was metastasis of adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemical positivity for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). In view of these findings, the Urology Department was consulted. A directed anamnesis revealed alterations in urination in recent months (pollakiuria and nocturia) and haemospermia. Physical examination Rectal examination: prostate volume II/IV, stony consistency in both lobes, fixed, suspicious for prostate cancer. Complementary tests PSA: 389 ng/ml Transrectal prostate biopsy: prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason 4+4=8, extensively affecting both lobes. Tc99m bone scan: imaging showed multiple areas of hyperenhancement involving the right zygomatic region and right internal orbital region, both costal ribs, dorsolumbar spine, iliac spine, right acetabular and ischiopubic region, left iliac spine and acetabular region and middle third of left femoral diaphysis.  Diagnosis Adenocarcinoma of the prostate Gleason 4+4=8 with multiple bone metastases. Treatment Treatment with complete hormonal blockade (Bicalutamide 50 mg/24h and Goserelin 10.8 mg/12 weeks) and bisphosphonates (Zoledronic acid 4 mg iv /4 weeks). Evolution After the establishment of the androgen blockade, there was a progressive improvement of the ocular symptoms. During the first 7 months of follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic. At 8 months the patient was admitted to the Urology Department with haematuria, which did not improve with continuous bladder lavage and required bladder TUR, which revealed a large prostatic neoformative process invading the bladder floor. Pathological anatomy of the resection fragments: foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma with involutive changes secondary to hormone treatment. Nine months after the initial diagnosis, the patient was admitted to our department again due to obstructive voiding syndrome, decreased diuresis, deterioration of renal function and dyspnoea. A thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed, showing right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis, multiple mediastinal adenopathies, multiple pulmonary metastases, ureteropielocaliceal dilatation of the left kidney and the already known multiple metastatic bone lesions of the blastoma type. Right pleurocentesis was performed (pleural fluid cytology was positive for malignant tumour cells). Percutaneous nephrostomy was not considered. The patient was monitored by the Palliative Care Unit. He died 10 months after the initial diagnosis.  "
"Patient Y. V. L., 30 years old. Eight years ago she had her first child; pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Three years ago, she had an unwanted pregnancy terminated by endometrial curettage, at which time she was fitted with a copper T-cup as a method of contraception. Approximately one year later, she began to present with irritative urinary symptoms, consisting of postvoid urethral burning, urethral and lower abdominal pain, frequency of urination and urinary urgency. She attended medical consultation, Escherichia coli was detected in urine cultures and she was treated with several courses of different antibiotics with the diagnosis of infectious cystitis. The previous symptoms subsided, but within weeks of completing the aforementioned treatments, they returned, with greater intensity. Finally, sudden interruption of the urinary stream and dyspareunia were added to the symptoms described above. In the midst of this situation, the patient became pregnant again, presumably with the copper T placed in utero, and decided to carry to term. During the nine months of gestation, the above-mentioned urinary symptoms continued in a similar form and intensity. She gave birth without difficulty, this time a boy. Two months after the birth, and due to the persistence of the urinary symptoms, she decided to go to the urology clinic. Ultrasound of the urinary tract was ordered and it was reported that both kidneys were normal in position and morphology and that there was a large lithiasis in the bladder, approximately five centimetres in diameter, which moved with changes in the patient's position. An antero-posterior X-ray of the pelvis was performed, showing the presence of a lithiasis measuring approximately five by three centimetres in size, in the projection of the small pelvis and with a copper T inside it.  It was decided to perform a suprapubic cystolithotomy. During the cystolithotomy, the bladder mucosa was found to be very erythematous and bleeding easily. The lithiasis, located at the bottom of the bladder, was fragmented during the extraction manoeuvre with the forceps, revealing the copper T with lithiasic incrustations inside. The foreign body was then stripped of its lining and was found to be intact.  The patient was maintained with a urethral catheter for two weeks, and was treated with oral Ciprofloxacin, 500 milligrams every 12 hours for three weeks. The evolution was satisfactory and total cessation of symptoms was achieved.   "
"The patient was a 24-year-old white male with a non-painful mass in the right testicle, which the patient noticed by self-palpation. Serum beta-HCG and alpha-FP levels were normal. Ultrasonography was performed and the images were interpreted as a solid testicular tumour. The patient underwent a right inguinal radical orchiectomy, with normal postoperative course. Pathological findings: Macroscopic examination revealed an orchiectomy specimen measuring 5.5 x 4 x 4 cm and weighing 51 g, which, at the upper pole and located in the thickness of the testicular pulp, contained a cystic lesion measuring 1.4 cm, circumscribed by a capsule, with a keratotic content, crumbly consistency and whitish colouring; the surrounding testicular parenchyma retained a spongy and soft appearance. The only relevant finding in the rest of the specimen was a cystic formation in the spermatic cord, 1.2 cm in diameter, with a smooth, translucent wall and a watery content.  Microscopically, the intraparenchymatous lesion was represented by a cystic formation covered by a thin stratified squamous epithelium with a granular layer, peripherally delimited by a thin fibrous band, with no evidence of cutaneous appendages, whose lumen was occupied by abundant keratotic material, laminated and compact. The adjacent testicular parenchyma reflected normal characteristics, with an adequate maturational gradient of tubular germ cellularity. The cystic lesion of the spermatic cord corresponded to a spermatocele.   "
"A 56-year-old patient was referred to our department due to an incidental finding of a renal mass of 5 cm maximum diameter, left mesorenal on ultrasound during the study of a renoureteral crisis on the same side. The patient's only history was hyperuricaemia, and he did not report any episodes of haematuria. At the centre where the diagnosis was made, an extension study was performed with chest X-ray, haemogram, biochemistry and abdomino-pelvic computerised tomography, which revealed a tumour thrombus extending through the renal vein to the retrohepatic vena cava. In this case, the referring centre decided to place a filter in the inferior vena cava to prevent progression and embolisation of the thrombus. The patient was subsequently referred to our centre to assess surgical treatment, as the sending centre did not have a cardiac surgery service. To complete the study, we performed magnetic resonance urography (Uro-MRI) and angiographic study by computerised tomography (angio-CT) with cavography to assess as accurately as possible the extent of the thrombus and possible tumour vascular infiltration. Both scans report the retrohepatic extension of the thrombus, the apparent absence of vascular infiltration and adenopathy, as well as the presence of a metallic filter immediately above the thrombus, responsible for the artefaction of the images.  With the diagnosis of stage T3bN0M0 renal neoformation with level II tumour thrombus, it was decided to intervene, together with the cardiac surgery department of our centre, performing sternotomy and left subcostal laparotomy and, after freeing the splenic angle of the colon by opening the retroperitoneum at the level of the mesentery, left radical nephrectomy with the nephrectomy specimen remaining anchored by the thrombosed renal vein. Subsequently, and under extracorporeal circulation with deep hypothermia and cerebral retroperfusion, the filter is removed by closing it and traction under fluoroscopic control from its insertion point at jugular level, with control by right auriculotomy of the possible dissemination to the lung of small thrombi during the removal manoeuvre, followed by resection of the renal vein and its ostium due to suspicion of infiltration of the same and thrombectomy by traction to subsequently repair the defect with a Goretex® patch, the patient requiring anticoagulation with dicoumarinic drugs for 3 months until endothelisation of the synthetic graft.  The pathological anatomy reveals the existence of renal adenocarcinoma, Furhman grade III, which infiltrates the renal capsule without going beyond it, as well as the renal vein, without infiltrating the vena cava (pT3bNoMo) with thrombus of exclusively tumour origin. The patient continued to undergo check-ups in our consultations until, at the 12-month follow-up CT scan, a lytic lesion was found in the posterior lamina of the L2 vertebra. After an extension study with scintigraphy and total-body CT confirmed that it was a single lesion, he was referred to the neurosurgery department, where he underwent surgery and resection of the lesion was carried out. Currently, 20 months after the nephrectomy, the patient is undergoing check-ups by our service and the medical oncology service, and is asymptomatic and with no signs of recurrence.   "
"A 72-year-old male patient was referred from another centre for a short-standing right thyroid nodule, with signs of airway compression. Ultrasound showed images typical of multinodular goitre with the presence of a solid nodule in the right lobe and scintigraphy detected a cold area at this level. Prior to admission, a FNA had been performed which was insufficient for diagnosis and its subsequent repetition showed signs of follicular hyperplasia, so it was decided to perform a right hemithyroidectomy, with intraoperative control. A brownish, pale, 2.6 cm nodule was detected in the specimen and processed for histological study (see below). After the diagnosis, the patient's history was investigated at other centres and it was discovered that 17 years earlier he had undergone a right radical nephrectomy for renal carcinoma. After 9 months the patient showed cervical swelling and multiple cervical adenopathies were detected by imaging techniques, as well as space-occupying images in the left pyriform sinus. The evolution of the lesions required tracheotomy. After three months of this last picture, the patient was referred to palliative care due to the absence of therapeutic possibilities.  "
"A 37-year-old man, with no personal or urological history of interest, who came to our surgery referred from the emergency department for pain and swelling of the left testicle. He referred a picture of progressive left testicular swelling of two months' evolution. He reported no fever, no accompanying urological symptoms, and no general malaise. On palpation, the left testicle was indurated and slightly painful, with a normal epididymis. The right testicle was normal in size and consistency. Testicular ultrasound showed a large nodular lesion in the left testicle, with a mixed pattern of cystic areas and areas with fine echogenic content, and solid nodular lesions in the right testicle, findings related to bilateral testicular neoplasia.  Tumour markers showed elevated α-FTP (48.4 ng/mL), normal β-HCG (<0.6 mIU/mL) and normal LDH. No pathological findings of interest were found in the thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan. The patient was referred to the fertility department for seminal cryopreservation. Subsequently, a left inguinal orchiectomy was performed with high cord ligation, and a right testicular biopsy via the inguinal route, after clamping the spermatic cord, which was reported intraoperatively as positive for malignant germ cells, so the surgery was completed with a right inguinal orchiectomy. The anatomopathological study was reported as follows: Left testicle: tumour 5 cm in diameter with cystic areas, corresponding to a mixed germinal tumour formed in similar proportions by adult embryonal carcinoma and teratoma with both mature and immature elements, which does not exceed the albuginea.  Right testicle: greyish tumour 2.5 cm in diameter, corresponding to seminoma of the classic variety, with images of intratubular neoplasia, without involvement of the albuginea, epididymis or spermatic cord.  Adjuvant chemotherapy treatment was administered with the modified BEP scheme (x2 cycles), subsequently presenting negative markers: α-FTP (3.7 ng/mL), β-HCG (<0.6 mIU/mL) and normal LDH. Currently, 10 months after the initial diagnosis of stage I bilateral testicular tumour, the patient is asymptomatic, with negative tumour markers, normal radiological studies and on hormone replacement therapy with periodic controls of testosterone levels.

"This is a 42-year-old man with no medical history of interest, and with vasectomy surgery as the only urological history. He came to our clinic due to a chance finding of a nodule in the right testicle. An ultrasound scan was requested, which revealed a well-defined, homogeneous, hypoechoic image of homogeneous density, located in the upper pole of the right testicle. The alpha-fetoprotein and beta-HCG tumour markers were normal, as was the rest of the physical examination, where no signs of hormonal overproduction were observed. It was therefore decided to perform an intraoperative biopsy of the nodule, which was reported as a low-grade spindle-shaped tumour without being able to rule out malignancy, so it was decided to perform a radical right orchiectomy via the inguinal route. The patient had a good postoperative evolution and was discharged the following day. The definitive anatomopathological report was a non-specific spindle-shaped tumour of the sexual stroma. No signs of recurrence or progression have been observed in the subsequent follow-up of this patient.   "
"A 77 year old male patient with multiple cardiopathogenic factors, and the only urological history was benign prostatic hypertrophy. He was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department for the study of constitutional symptoms of 4 months' evolution with anorexia and loss of about 15 kg of weight, accompanied by generalised weakness and epigastric cramping pain lasting minutes. She had no other accompanying symptoms. A gastrointestinal examination (gastroscopy, colonoscopy, echoendoscopy) was performed and was normal. The physical examination was normal, except for an increase in the size of the genitalia, for which an ultrasound was performed, with the result of a bilateral hydrocele, more marked on the left side, with multinodular morphology destructuring in the left teste, which made it necessary to rule out an underlying malignant process. On examination, in addition to presenting positive bilateral transillumination, a 4 cm hard nodule was palpable in the upper pole of the left teste, suggestive of a solid mass. Remote imaging tests (CT, MRI) were negative. Germinal tumour markers and LDH were requested and were negative. Left inguinal radical orchiectomy was performed. The macroscopic description of the specimen, measuring 9 x 6.5cm, showed scarce healthy testicular parenchyma adjacent to the upper pole, in which a solid, multinodular, whitish tumour mass with some brownish areas was found, measuring 4cm in diameter.  Microscopic analysis showed areas of sarcomatoid pattern and sheet-like growth together with areas where the cells were arranged in a chordate pattern or forming trabeculae with the presence of vascular structures. The cells were pyramidal, with large cytoplasm, nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli acquiring in areas a very clear, lipidified cytoplasm. The mitotic index was high, being higher than 5 mitoses x 10 HPF in the areas of sheet-like growth. The tumour contacted the albuginea and infiltrated the epididymis with virtually no viable seminiferous tubules remaining. There were also images highly suggestive of vascular invasion. In the sections of respected testicular parenchyma, the tubules showed hyalinised basement membrane, with an atrophic appearance. Immunohistochemical techniques showed positivity for Inhibin, keratin, CK8, CK18, Vimentin, EMA and S-100. Ki67 showed intense positivity in approximately 30-40% of tumour cells. It was negative for Progesterone, PLAP, AFP, HCG, Chromogranin and HMB45. With all these findings, the diagnosis was malignant Sertoli cell tumour, with variation of histological patterns, classified as Classical type. Twelve months later, the general symptoms persisted, which led to a new admission to Internal Medicine, with suspicion of Systemic Inflammatory Disease. The serum and imaging controls in relation to the testicular process remain within normal parameters.   "
"A 33-year-old male smoker of a packet of cigarettes a day with no other history of interest came to the emergency department for ten days with penile induration at the base of the penis. Examination revealed an indurated longitudinal cord at the base of the penis in a dorsal location, mobile and painful. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was palpable. The patient was afebrile. Penile Doppler ultrasound was performed and showed an induration corresponding to segmental thrombosis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis. Coagulation study was normal. Diagnostic Judgement: Mondor's disease. The patient received anti-inflammatory treatment. He did not attend the check-up.  "
"A 44 year old male patient, whose personal history included testicular trauma in childhood which did not require surgery. He presented with an increase in the size of the right hemiscrotal associated with slight testicular discomfort for the last 7 months and self-palpation of a right paratesticular mass. Physical examination revealed a penis with no findings of interest, a left teste of normal size, mobility and consistency, and an enlarged right hemiscroctum with a normal teste and an adjacent structure in the upper pole separate from the theoretical right teste, not indurated or painful to the touch. In order to make a first approximation to the diagnosis, germinal tumour markers were requested, with normal results, and a testicular ultrasound scan showed a structure adjacent to the right teste in its upper pole that was differentiated from it, smaller in size and ultrasonographically similar to the teste, associated with a right hydrocele, so that the initial suspicion was of polyorchidism with associated hydrocele.  A CT scan was also performed, showing two structures of similar appearance in the right hemiscrotal area, one of which was smaller than the other, with no other exploratory findings of interest.  An exploratory scrototomy was performed, showing a right hydrocele and two interrelated structures, compatible with teste, sharing epididymis and deferens. A biopsy was taken of the smaller structure and eversion of the vagina was performed to resolve the hydrocele. The pathological anatomy showed preserved testicular tissue with no signs of atrophy.   "
"A 9-year-old girl was admitted to the paediatric department from the emergency department for the second episode of macroscopic haematuria in 20 days. No family history of interest, personal history of facial haemihypertrophy due to congenital torticollis, chickenpox, infectious mononucleosis, nocturnal enuresis until the age of 7, pneumonia at 9 months and trauma to the coccyx. Physical examination: slight skin pallor, weight within the 25-50 percentile and height within the 50-75 percentile. No other findings. Complementary examinations: complete blood count, biochemistry, coagulation, urine culture, renal function, enolase, alpha-fetoprotein, chest X-ray and ECG were normal. Urinary sediment: macroscopic haematuria. Abdominal ultrasound: 5cm diameter mass in the left kidney, complex with cystic/necrotic areas. The paediatrics department consulted our department and decided to perform an abdominal CT scan with contrast after ultrasound findings, with the finding of a mass depending on the left kidney, in the anterior face, with cystic content and irregular endoluminal thickening. It presents a thick and irregular septum of similar density to that obtained in the internal irregularities described. No inter-cavo-aortic or periaortic adenomegaly was observed. The mass is compatible with Wilms' tumour or adeno-carcinoma. It was decided to perform a left nephrectomy: the mass measured 4.5 cm in diameter.  The anatomopathological diagnosis was cystic mesoblastic nephroma (multilocular renal cyst).   "
"A 43-year-old housewife, allergic to iodinated contrast agent and smoker of 1 packet of cigarettes a day, hysterectomised and right hysterectomised for endometriosis. The patient was being studied by the haematology department for isolated leukocytosis; an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed, finding a destructured left kidney with cystic images or hydronephrosis, and she was referred to our clinic. On interrogation, she refers to a 27-day admission, when she was 12 years old, to another hospital for lumbar pain with haematuria, without knowing the diagnosis. She also reported occasional mechanical low back pain with moderate asthenia. Physical examination: no findings. Complementary tests: haemogram with slight leukocytosis without deviation of the leukocyte formula, the rest being normal, biochemistry and coagulation normal. MAG-3-Tc-99m renogram: normal right kidney. Heterogeneous uptake in the left kidney with superior calyceal dilatation, retention in the left upper pole presenting a slowing of the excretory curve whose activity disappears in late images. CT scan without contrast: left upper polar renal cystic mass of approximately 12 cm maximum diameter displacing pancreas and spleen. Internally it was made up of multiple cysts of different sizes and had heterogeneous internal septa, some of them thick and irregular, suggestive of cystic multinodular cystic nephroma or cystic renal cell carcinoma. It was decided to perform a nephrectomy with left lymphadenectomy. The anatomopathological study of the specimen showed a kidney with a multicystic tumour measuring 9x10 cm that occupied most of the kidney. The contents of the cyst are amber without the presence of solid parts or adherence of the tumour to the capsule. The cavities are lined by a simple epithelium with frequent cells with a ""tack"" morphology. The intercellular stroma is fibrous. Well-demarcated lesion of preserved renal parenchyma. Pathological diagnosis of benign multilocular cystic tumour of the kidney.   "
"57-year-old woman, personal history of depression, under medical treatment, undergoing surgery for varicose veins. She was being examined by her primary care doctor for low back pain of 1 year's duration, under medical treatment with NSAIDs. An abdominal ultrasound scan found a mixed cyst (solid and liquid) in the right kidney measuring 7.4 x 4.2 cm in diameter with suspected hydatid cyst. The patient was referred to our clinic. Examination was unremarkable and laboratory tests, including hydatid cyst serology, were normal. An abdominal CT scan was requested to complete the study and a tumour was found in the right interpolar and upper polar region with a well-defined outline, internal partitioning and low density of content with a size of 70x45x40mm corresponding to a complex cyst; no regional adenopathies were seen. The characteristics of the cystic tumour do not allow malignancy to be totally ruled out,  A right nephrectomy was performed and anatomopathological study of the specimen revealed a 4.5 cm multiloculated cystic formation with serous content, well defined and lined with flat epithelium, with a diagnosis of multicystic nephroma.   "
"A 68 year old male patient with a personal history of TUR of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia in another centre, whose pathological study revealed the presence of a Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma with PSA values within the normal range and who was subsequently treated with radiotherapy with radical intent and is currently in a disease-free interval. He consulted for pain in the right groin for more than 2 years, which increased with standing and decreased with decubitus. Diagnosed with a direct right inguinal hernia, he underwent an inguinal herniorrhaphy and correction of a concomitant right hydrocele. At the same time, a mameloned fleshy tumour was observed attached to the upper pole of the testicle, measuring 2 centimetres in diameter. Right radical orchiectomy via the inguinal route and excision of the spermatic cord above the internal inguinal ring was performed. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy. The anatomopathological study revealed a leiomyosarcoma with positive immunohistochemistry for Actin and Vimentin and negative for Prostate Specific Antigen.  The extension study was normal. Complementary radiotherapy was considered. After 9 months he noted the appearance of an outgrowth lesion measuring 3 x 2.5 centimetres in the herniorrhaphy scar which was resected, reporting a recurrence of leiomyosarcoma with increased mitotic activity. She did not receive adjuvant treatment. After 6 months he noticed the appearance of a new nodular lesion on the right flank with progressive increase in size. The C.A.T. showed a nodule that infiltrated the subcutaneous fat and the iliopsoas muscle in depth. The tumour was resected together with fibres of the lesser oblique, transverse muscle and iliopsoas muscle. The pathology report is compatible with infiltration by leiomyosarcoma. At this point, adjuvant therapy with adriamycin and ifosfamide for six cycles was proposed. After 12 months, the patient underwent surgery again for local recurrence, stony to the touch, which trapped arterial and venous vessels in the groin area. The report concludes recurrence of high-grade leiomyosarcoma. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an adenopathic inguinal mass with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy that ruled out any possibility of radical treatment. It was decided to administer second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel and gemcitabine for six cycles. After 8 months of disease-free interval, a new mass appeared in the inguinal region together with pulmonary metastases in the control CAT scan and palliative treatment with adriamycin was decided. Prior to this new recurrence, the patient presented an episode of haematuria, which was confirmed by ultrasound scanning and confirmed by cystoscopy, and showed the existence of an excrescent lesion in the right bladder wall measuring 3 centimetres. The patient rejected the possibility of U.T.R. as he was undergoing chemotherapy and subsequent deterioration of his general condition.   "
"A 58-year-old patient of sub-Saharan origin came to the emergency department with sweating and fever with left lumbar pain, heaviness in the left flank and dysuria for about 15 days. His personal history did not include any significant pathology: No DM. No hypertension. No known allergies. Former smoker for 8 years. No haematuria. No colic. No UTIs. He reports that in the last two weeks he has had occasional fever, sweating, heaviness in the left flank with lumbar pain on the same side and voiding symptoms with an acceptable urinary stream, dysuria, not shortness of breath, no dribbling, no urgency with night-time voiding once and daytime voiding every 3-4 hours with a feeling of complete emptiness. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass effect in the left flank on deep palpation. Rectal examination showed a grade I-II prostate without suspicious lesions. Complementary tests showed: normal haemogram with signs of eosinophilia. Normal biochemistry. Other normal, negative urine analysis. X-ray of the genito-urinary tract showed a mass effect in the left flank that blurred the psoas line on that side. Renal ultrasound: multiple cysts in the left kidney. Abdominopelvic CT scan: cystic lesions with daughter vesicles, compatible with renal hydatid disease.  Echinococcus/Hemag antibody serology was requested, which was POSITIVE at figures above 1/2.621.440. The study was completed with MRI to obtain a more complete iconography and to assess relations with adjacent structures. In view of the suspected diagnosis, surgery was decided on the affected renal unit, it being impossible to perform conservative surgery during the surgical procedure and the patient underwent a complete left nephroureterectomy due to suspicion of communication of the hydatid cyst with the duct due to the thickness of the duct. Prior to surgical treatment, the patient received a course of Albendazole and another after surgery. After treatment, the patient's antibody titration figures fell and three years after the procedure the patient is asymptomatic and analytically free of disease.   "
"A 60-year-old man, with no pathological history of interest, who was referred to us from the Urology Department of our Centre with a diagnosis of stage IV prostate adenocarcinoma with multiple metastatic bone involvement and in a phase of hormone resistance. In February 2004, due to prostatic syndrome (pollakiuria and urinary urgency), his Primary Care Physician (PCP) had performed a PSA test which showed a value of 12 ng/ml, and for this reason he was referred to the specialist. He underwent transrectal ultrasound and ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy which was reported as: bilobular adenocarcinoma, Gleason 7 (4+3). In the extension study (blood tests, MRI and bone scintigraphy), retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and multiple foci of pathological hypercaptation (spine, neck and femoral diaphysis, bony pelvis) were observed. Complete androgen blockade with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (A-LHRH) and antiandrogen was instituted. With this treatment, the PSA level normalised within 4 months (June 04). The patient was receiving analgesic treatment for bone pain with NSAIDs and morphine. He was also treated with dorsolumbar vertebral irradiation with 30 Gy administered in 10 sessions. In April 2006, and with the patient asymptomatic, the PSA began to rise progressively to 7.3, 13.1, 21 ng/ml, maintaining testosterone at castration levels. It was decided, at this point, to discontinue the antiandrogen. The biochemical response was good and normalisation was achieved in August 06. Unfortunately, in November 06, she attended the emergency department with intense generalised and incapacitating bone pain despite the increase in analgesic doses (EAV=8-9), for which she received treatment with strontium (St) in the Nuclear Medicine Department. In addition, the clinical picture is accompanied by PSA figures of 850 ng/ml. In December 06 we decided, with his informed consent, to start palliative QT with Docetaxel and prednisone. We also started therapy with bone resorption inhibitors (zoledronic acid). The clinical response was satisfactory with analgesic control (VAS=2-3) and a reduction in PSA to 150 ng/ml. On 15-02-07, she attended the emergency department and reported that for the last 15 days she had been noticing protrusion of the left eyeball and difficulty in fully separating the eyelids. Neurological examination Proptosis, eyelid ptosis, mydriasis with little reactivity secondary to involvement of the third pair. No orbital murmurs. Orbital MRI Metastatic replacement of the entire central segment of the cranial base, the bone marrow of the vertebrae included in the study and part of the cranial diploe. Involvement of the roof and lateral wall of the left orbit which appear expanded and cause proptosis of the eyeball. The left greater sphenoid wing is replaced and thickened and there is a clear extension to the wall of the left cavernous sinus and the cleft. Similar changes are seen in the bones comprising the contralateral orbit, but less advanced. The lesion of the roof of the left orbit is accompanied by a soft tissue lesion causing inferior displacement of the orbital musculature. Contrast sequences show heterogeneous hyperenhancement of all the lesions described.  He received palliative irradiation of the affected areas and presented a frank and rapid deterioration, dying on 21-03-07.   "
"A 32-year-old man presented with long-standing low back pain that worsened in the last few days, as well as a loss of thirty pounds of body weight over a period of approximately three months. No symptoms and signs of adrenal hyperfunction were detected. On abdominal examination, a hard tumour was palpated in the left hypochondrium reaching the mesogastrium and left iliac fossa. The imaging studies performed were: abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray, descending urogram and computed axial tomography. No metastases were detected in the chest X-ray. The findings obtained in the other imaging studies indicated the presence of an extensive, well-demarcated mass with regular contours and heterogeneous signs suggestive of haemorrhagic and necrotic areas. There was displacement of neighbouring structures with infiltration. No infiltration of the liver or inferior vena cava was demonstrated. Treatment consisted of surgical excision via the thoraco-abdominal route with clamping of the thoracic aorta to control transoperative haemorrhage. In addition to resection of the tumour, a left nephrectomy and en bloc splenectomy with hilar adenopathy bundles were performed.  The excised tumour was well encapsulated, weighing 4350 g and with a maximum diameter of 24 cm. Macroscopic examination showed a solid mass with haemorrhagic areas. The tumour infiltrated the capsule and the perirenal fat of the entire upper pole of the left kidney as well as the spleen. Histological examination revealed a diagnosis of adrenal gland carcinoma. The postoperative course was satisfactory and the patient was discharged on the tenth day after surgery. Survival was six months. Death occurred due to disease progression.   "
"A 30-year-old woman, smoker of about six cigarettes a day, with a history of miscarriage two and a half years before being examined in the Gynaecology Department for infertility. In this context, during a vaginal ultrasound scan, an exophytic intravesical lesion of approximately 24 mm in diameter was found, located on the right posterolateral wall, with septations inside.  She was referred to the Urology Department, referring certain micturition discomfort coinciding with menstruation, without macroscopic haematuria or other accompanying manifestations. Blood tests showed normal values, while in the elemental urine only 18 red blood cells/mcL were present. Intravenous urography was requested, with no other significant findings; cystoscopy was also performed, which revealed an exophytic lesion, approximately one endoscopic field in size, located at the bottom of the bladder, with a pseudocystic surface. Transurethral resection of the lesion described was indicated and was achieved completely, with good postoperative evolution. The result of the histopathological study revealed a bladder wall lined by focally hyperplastic endothelium, with glandular formations of predominantly tubal morphology in the lamina propria and muscular tissue, with associated endometrial and endocervical components, all compatible with a diagnosis of bladder mullerianosis.  After one year of follow-up, the patient has remained asymptomatic, with no evidence of endoscopic recurrence at check-ups.   "
"A 38-year-old man, with no urological history of interest, who consulted for a slowly growing, progressive and painless tumour on the left scrotum that had been present for seven months. Physical examination revealed a soft mass of about 3 cm, not painful on palpation or adhered to adjacent structures, with negative transillumination and normal testicles. With negative testicular markers, an ultrasound scan was performed, which was reported as a homogeneous paratesticular lesion with regular borders of about 2 cm, suspicious of lipoma.  Given the diagnostic doubts, a surgical exploration was performed in which a lipoma of about 2 x 1.5 cm was observed in the spermatic cord, yellowish in colour, soft in consistency and easily resectable. Given the suspicion of paratesticular lipoma, a left inguinal excision of the mass was performed, separating it from the spermatic cord. Subsequently, the anatomopathological study revealed the presence of a well-differentiated LPS of the lipoma-like subtype. It was decided not to complete the surgery with orchiectomy due to the small size of the tumour and its lower grade stage associated with a good prognosis. After 26 months of surgical treatment the patient is asymptomatic with no evidence of tumour recurrence.   "
"A 59-year-old man who in 2004, after a study for constitutional syndrome, was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal tumour. After excision of the mass, measuring 16 x 13cm in diameter, located at the level of the FID, displacing the bladder and widely adhered to the parietal and parietocolic peritoneum, anatomopathological diagnosis of high-grade pleomorphic malignant fibrohistiocytoma-type sarcoma (Stage III-B) was made and complementary radiotherapy was administered. Two years after surgery she presented with progressive deterioration of general condition and a very painful right inguinoscrotal tumour. A testicular ultrasound scan found a 7cm, anechoic, oval, partially septate, cystic, anechoic image ascending the inguinal duct in a cranial location to the right teste. The CT scan showed a lesion with similar characteristics to those reported on ultrasonography.  On suspicion of tumour recurrence at the level of the spermatic cord, a right inguinal orchiectomy was performed with excision of the cystic mass, revealing areas of necrosis and infiltration of adjacent fat.  Histological examination revealed a 12 x 8cm tumour formed by spindle cells with abundant pleomorphic cells without affecting the testicle or epididymis, diagnostic of malignant pleomorphic fibrohistiocytoma, which reached the immediate vicinity of the surgical edge at some points, for which postoperative radiotherapy was subsequently administered. Six months after surgery on the paratesticular mass and after having recently completed radiotherapy treatment, she has presented an intra-abdominal recurrence and is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment with Epirubicin + Ifosfamide.   "
"We describe the case of a 91-year-old woman, type 2 diabetic treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents, hypertensive, and previously dependent for physical activities of daily living after an ischaemic stroke. The family reports that the patient has presented with vomiting, hypogastric pain and haematuria in the last 15 days. Initially treated with fosfomycin-trometamol on an outpatient basis, the condition worsened in the last 48 hours with jaundice and generalised abdominal pain, and the patient was brought to the Emergency Department. The patient was conscious, oriented, afebrile and normotensive. Physical examination revealed jaundice and abdominal pain on palpation in the hypogastrium and right hypochondrium, with no evidence of associated peritoneal irritation. Biochemistry showed poor glycaemic control (glucose: 571 mg/dL), cholestasis and cytolysis (total bilirubin: 10.9 mg/dL; direct bilirubin: 9.3 mg/dL; GOT: 57 U/L; GPT: 134 U/L; GGT: 806 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 657 U/L) and acute renal failure (creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL). The haemogram is practically normal (white blood cells: 11,990/mm3 with 75.9% neutrophils; haemoglobin: 15.5 g/dL; platelets: 217,000/mm3). Systematic urinalysis shows glycosuria, microhaematuria and negative nitrites. The urine sediment was clearly pathological, with abundant leukocytes and germs. Additional tests included a simple abdominal X-ray, which revealed the presence of ectopic air in the lower pelvis, probably in the bladder wall, suggestive of emphysematous cystitis, and an abdominal ultrasound, which confirmed the presence of gas bordering the bladder wall. In addition, there was evidence of a large dilatation of the gallbladder and the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tract, with suspicion of choledocholithiasis. Urine culture isolated more than 100,000 CFU/ml of Escherichia coli sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime-axetil, cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.  With a diagnosis of obstructive jaundice and emphysematous cystitis, admission was decided. Intravenous antibiotic treatment was initially started with piperacillin-tazobactam, urinary catheterisation and strict control of blood glucose levels. An abdominal-pelvic CT scan was requested which confirmed the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis. The obstructive jaundice resolved after retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic sphincterotomy, and no bile duct stones or bile duct dilatation were found in the control ultrasound.  After 5 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment, given the patient's good general condition, it was decided to discharge her from hospital with oral antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 14 days, maintaining the urinary catheter. The control urine culture after treatment was negative. A follow-up abdominal-pelvic CT scan showed no evidence of residual lesions.   "
"We present the case of a 69-year-old female patient with a history of arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, with end-stage chronic renal failure of unidentified aetiology, nephrogenic anaemia treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating factors and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Residual diuresis was around 200 ml. per day. In 2004 she started renal replacement therapy with haemodialysis, and was subsequently placed on the waiting list for a renal transplant. In January 2008 she received a cadaver donor kidney transplant in the right iliac fossa. The postoperative period was satisfactory except for two medical complications: development of diabetes mellitus requiring insulin administration and toxicity due to calcineurin inhibitors, which meant that the graft was initially non-functional. She was discharged in the fifth week after the operation with creatinine of 0.9 mg/dl and diuresis of around 2000 ml per day, receiving triple immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. He was readmitted two weeks later for a condition consisting of significant oedema in the right lower limb and deterioration of renal function, with a decrease in diuresis and an increase in plasma creatinine concentration to 2 mg/dl. He was in good general condition, with fever and haemodynamic manifestations absent. ECHO showed a large peri-graft collection, later studied with CT, extending from a level slightly more cranial than the aortic bifurcation to the rectum, causing compression of the iliac vessels and displacement of the bladder.  Percutaneous puncture and pig-tail placement to drain the collection is followed by a great improvement in symptoms and biochemical analysis of the fluid obtained (creatinine 1.67 mg/dl, Na 146 mEq/l, K 4.3 mEq/l) confirms the clinical suspicion of lymphocele. Surgical treatment was indicated, and once infection had been ruled out, the lymphocele was marsupialised into the peritoneal cavity laparoscopically. The patient was discharged from surgery on the third postoperative day, with normal renal function and asymptomatic. A follow-up CT scan at 14 days showed resolution of the lymphocele.    "
"Female patient, 62 years old, poorly controlled diabetic, obese, with a history of unresolved left chorioriform lithiasis. She consulted for fever and left lumbalgia of 7 days' evolution, with oral mycosis and frank deterioration of general condition. She presented leukocytosis with marked neutrophilia, hyperglycaemia with ketoacidosis and elevated urea and creatinine levels. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen, with pain in the left flank and positive left renal percussion. Abdominal ultrasound and direct abdominal X-ray were performed, which led to the diagnosis by identifying air in the left renal fossa. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan showed air in the left kidney and perirenal tissues, which infiltrated the abdominal wall. Due to the rapid deterioration of his general condition, drainage of the renal fossa was performed by lumbotomy to avoid contamination of the peritoneal cavity, evacuating the gas and debriding necrotic tissue. After an initial improvement, signs of sepsis reappeared and simple nephrectomy was performed a week later. Good postoperative evolution, 14 days later new sepsis of respiratory origin. He started with purulent secretion through the wound, a toilette was performed, but he died 48 hours later due to multiple organ dysfunction with nosocomial pneumonia.   "
"We present the case of an 85-year-old man with a history of prostate adenocarcinoma treated with LHRH analogues, maintaining adequate biochemical control of the disease, who consulted for a picture of 2 months' evolution consisting of an enlarged left hemiscrotal, in the absence of pain, fever or other symptoms. Physical examination revealed a larger than normal left hemiscrotal, under tension, with a mass that prevented identification of the left testicle. Blood tests were requested, confirming beta-HCG and alpha-fetoprotein within the reference ranges, and scrotal ultrasound, reported as: ""large cystic mass in the left scrotum, measuring 10x8.3 cm, compressing and displacing the testicle, compatible with a large cyst dependent on the epididymis, although other possibilities, such as cystadenoma, cannot be ruled out"". Based on the clinical data, and assessing the differential diagnoses and the patient's situation, he was offered a bilateral orchiectomy, the right subalbuginea and the left inguinal, which he accepted.  The surgical specimen weighed 550 g, measured 11x11x9 cm and had a brownish-haemorrhagic colouring; when cut, a cystic cavity compressing the testicular parenchyma was evident. Microscopic pathological study, including sections of the cyst wall and the rest of the teste, revealed a cystic lesion lined with flat epithelium, with areas of ulceration, haemorrhage and necrotic tissue; the testicular parenchyma showed intense signs of atrophy, fibrosis and vascular congestion, with an almost total absence of germ cells in the seminiferous tubules.  The anatomopathological diagnosis was: benign testicular cyst compatible with cystic dilatation of the rete testis.   "
"A 41-year-old man with a history of allergy to penicillins, arterial hypertension under medical treatment and psoriasis came to our clinic for haematuria. Urine cytology was performed with atypia suggestive of malignancy and an abdominal ultrasound scan showed a bladder mass on the left lateral side measuring 65x46 mm producing a left ureterohydronephrosis. In view of these findings, the patient underwent TUR of the bladder and an infiltrative mass was resected, occupying the entire left lateral aspect and obscuring the ureteral orifice. A left nephrostomy was also performed. The pathological anatomy of the mass was undifferentiated undifferentiated undifferentiated urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. In view of this, an extension study was performed with a normal thoracoabdominal CT scan, normal bone scintigraphy and left retrograde pyelography, which revealed ureterohydronephrosis up to its entry into the bladder, with no mass visible within the ureteral lumen. As the extension study was negative, a radical cystoprostatectomy with Bricker shunt was performed. The pathological anatomy showed high-grade solid urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the perivesical fat, prostate and urethra with tumour-free surgical edges. Neoplastic cells in the vascular lumen were visualised in peritumoral vessels. In the left iliobturator chain, lymph nodes infiltrated by urothelial carcinoma (pT4aN1M0). Postoperatively, the patient presented recurrent episodes of anaemia and thrombopenia that did not improve despite transfusion of red blood cells and platelets. Renal function remained normal and the bricker function was correct from the beginning. After 5 days, the patient was successfully tolerated. Given the isolated signs of anaemia (around 7 g/dl haemoglobin) and thrombocytopenia (around 20,000 platelets/ml), an abdominal CT scan was performed where no haematomas were observed and the drainage debit was low from the outset, ruling out active bleeding. Enoxaparin was withdrawn to avoid pharmacological causes of thrombopenia. Coagulation was always normal and there were no signs of bleeding, ruling out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A haemolytic picture was also ruled out as bilirubin was normal and the direct Coombs' test was negative. As the cause of the recurrent episodes of anaemia and thrombopenia was not found, a sternal bone marrow aspiration-puncture was performed and metastatic urothelial carcinoma cells were obtained. On discovering the infiltration of the bone marrow by the bladder tumour, haemotherapy substitution treatment was carried out and chemotherapy treatment was started, and the patient died 3 weeks later.   "
"A 56-year-old woman was initially evaluated for intestinal disorders. Initial physical examination and routine laboratory workup were normal. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 12 cm solid mass behind the left kidney with abnormal vascularity. Computed tomography showed a well-circumscribed mass behind the left kidney that enhanced after intravenous contrast administration and had a clear fatty plane between the left kidney and the mass. A fine needle puncture was performed to obtain histology. The pathology report was of a benign or low malignant potential mesenchymal tumour. Laparoscopic exploration was decided.  Surgical technique: Under general anaesthesia the patient was positioned in right lateral decubitus after placement of an orogastric and bladder catheter. A single dose of cephalothin 2gr was administered intravenously. Pneumoperitoneum was performed with a Veress needle at 12 mmHg. Two trocars of 1 2 mm and 5 mm respectively were placed forming a rhombus as shown in Figure 3. The colon and spleen were widely mobilised towards the midline. After opening Gerota's fascia the mass was clearly visualised over the outer edge of the kidney. Preserving the tumour borders, the mass was released from its contact with the renal capsule. An area of 2cm was observed firmly adhered to the renal capsule requiring resection and subsequent argon laser fulguration of the cruciate bed. The surgical specimen was removed in a plastic bag by oblique extension of the left flank trocar incision. A Blake drain was left through the 5 mm trocar opening. The operative time was 135 minutes with an estimated bleeding of 200 ml. The patient progressed favourably and was discharged on the third postoperative day. The final pathological analysis revealed a very low grade leiomyosarcoma. After a follow-up of 6 months the patient has recovered completely with no evidence of her underlying disease.   "
"A 53-year-old male patient came to the urology department for a left testicular mass. Physical examination revealed a palpation of a lesion in the upper pole of the left testicle, firm in consistency and not painful. A testicular ultrasound scan was performed showing an area measuring 2 x 2 cm, of heterogeneous echogenicity, with multiple cystic areas, suggestive of a possible neoplasm. Tumour markers were negative. Given the high suspicion of testicular tumour, we decided to perform a radical left orchiectomy. In the histological study of the surgical specimen, macroscopically there was a well-defined tumour, 1.8 cm in diameter, yellowish in colour and with a stony consistency. Microscopically it is made up of horny scales and nests of squamous epithelium in which ""shadow"" epithelial cells are recognisable. Most of this material is calcified and ossified, and a fibrous reaction is observed around the lesion, leading to the formation of a pseudocapsule that delimits the tumour. In this fibrous pseudocapsule, bundles of smooth muscle are focally identified. The testicular parenchyma shows moderate interstitial oedema. The epididymis and spermatic cord show no relevant histological alterations. The anatomo-pathological diagnosis was testicular dermoid cyst (mature testicular teratoma), pseudopilomatrixoma variant.  After orchiectomy, an extension study was carried out by chest X-ray and abdominopelvic CT scan, with no evidence of systemic extension of the disease. Testicular tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein, beta-HCG and LDH) were negative. The patient is asymptomatic and free of disease at present after 6 months of follow-up.   "
"We present the case of a 65-year-old man who consulted the emergency department in August 2005, presenting with urinary pain in the hypochondrium and right inguinal region of 72 hours' evolution, fever, general malaise and irritative urinary symptoms. She had a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus 2 under treatment, her mother had breast cancer, her father had coronary heart disease and her sister had a brain tumour. On admission to the emergency department she had blood pressure (BP): 130/80, heart rate (HR): 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate (RR): 18 breaths per minute, temperature (T): 38.7 degrees Celsius (oC), with no signs of respiratory distress. In the neck there was a thyroid mass measuring 4 x 6 cm, indurated, not very mobile, not painful on palpation, with no inflammatory changes. Physical examination revealed a large mass in the right flank and iliac fossa which continued to the inguinoscrotal region, displacing the left hemiscrotal and penis, with no evidence of inguinal adenopathy or local inflammatory changes, the mass had a firm, hard consistency, non-mobile, with negative transillumination; the right testicle was not palpable due to the mass effect, the left testicle was present, rectal examination was unremarkable. The patient presented with pain on right lumbar percussion and urinary tract infection was confirmed by urine culture; intravenous antibiotic treatment was started. Lactate dehydrogenase dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were measured and the result was 300 U/L. During her hospitalisation she presented hyperglycaemia (259 mg/dl), normal creatinine (0.8 mg/dl), leucocytes 17850 neutrophils 86% haemoglobin 16 platelets 275 000. After antibiotic management, signs of systemic inflammatory response decreased. A contrasted abdominal tomography (CT) scan (September 2005) showed the presence of a large mass in the right iliac fossa that displaced the bladder to the contralateral side and continued to the right hemiscrotal, solid in appearance, with well-defined borders, diffusely involving the ipsilateral testicle. There was no evidence of locoregional adenopathy. The tumour was excised together with a radical orchidectomy on the same side of a semi-ovoid, lobulated, yellowish, smooth-surfaced mass measuring 34 x 22 x 17 cm and weighing 5786 grams. Complete removal was achieved without complications, the patient presented good clinical evolution post-surgery and it was therefore decided to discharge the patient on the 5th day post-surgery.  The pathology report confirms that the tumour lesion corresponds to a malignant neoplasm of mesenchymal and sarcomatous origin formed by well-differentiated adipose cells in the middle of which some bizarre pleomorphic cells are observed, constituting a dominant picture of well-differentiated liposarcoma, lobulations of cartilage-like tissue are observed, which corresponds to a component of the divergent tumour, where there is cartilage-like tissue with a malignant hyaline tumoural appearance that oscillates between a grade II and III chondrosarcoma component. The tumour corresponds to a dedifferentiated liposarcoma in which the adipose component is a classic well-differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma from which islands of high-grade chondrosarcoma component emerge, such findings corresponding to dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the spermatic cord with tumour-free resection margins. Local radiotherapy was suggested but the patient refused, accepting only periodic clinical check-ups. During the follow-up, an aspiration cytology of the cervical mass was performed and the pathology report showed papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is currently being followed up by oncology. Forty-eight months after excision of the inguinoscrotal mass, the patient is asymptomatic, with no clinical or paraclinical signs of tumour recurrence.   "
"A 24-year-old patient with a twin brother who in December 2005 underwent surgery for a combined neoplasm (mucinous adenocarcinoma and goblet cell carcinoid, T4N2M1) infiltrating the appendicular wall and meso, with multiple peritoneal implants and involvement of 8 of the 29 isolated lymph nodes. He underwent right hemicolectomy, peritonectomy and resection of macroscopic visceral peritoneal implants. Subsequently, adjuvant chemotherapy with mFOLFOX4 was started for 12 cycles, with episodes of diarrhoea after the second and third cycle and a hurticarial reaction after the 7th cycle. At the start of chemotherapy, 5HIAA in 24-hour urine was within normal parameters and body scanning with In.111 pentreotide and SPECT showed no alterations. Ten months after surgery, he presented with acute testicular pain. On physical examination, the right testicle was horinzontalised, enlarged, hard and irregular in the upper pole, as well as thickening of the spermatic cord. In the testicular Doppler ultrasound, the right testicle showed increased calibre of the vascular structures, thickened epididymis, hypoechoic and with peripheral vascularisation. Anechoic scrotal content was observed with mobile echogenic content, compatible with complicated hydrocele (pyocele and haematocele...). An urgent surgical exploration was decided, in which haematocele and thickening with induration of the testicular vagina were observed. Intraoperative pathology revealed infiltration by mucinous adenocarcinoma. Radical right orchiectomy with ligation of the cord at the root of the scrotum was performed. Definitive pathology analysis showed a neoplasm of the testicular vagina consisting of mucinous lakes and clusters of epithelial cells, mostly in signet ring morphology, with no involvement of the epididymis or testis.  After testicular surgery, chemotherapy was administered with FOLFIRI plus BEVACIZUMAB in the 3rd cycle. Nine months after the orchiectomy, the patient presented hepatic, pancreatic and regional adenopathic progression, presenting subocclusive pictures. He died 21 months after diagnosis.   "
"We describe the case of a 67 year old woman, with no urological history of interest, who presented with macroscopic monosymptomatic haematuria with clots of 2 days' evolution. Initially, conservative treatment was decided with bladder catheterisation and a saline solution washout circuit. After 24 hours the patient was anaemic and hypotensive, requiring vasoactive amines and polytransfusion of blood concentrates. An abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed, which revealed a bladder completely occupied by a large bladder clot and secondary moderate bilateral ureterohydronephrosis.  The patient was operated on endoscopically and approximately 1 litre of clot was evacuated. The bladder mucosa is hyperemic, with diffuse bleeding, with no evidence of endovesical lesions. Electrocoagulation of several areas with active bleeding was performed. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with orotracheal intubation and support treatment with vasoactive amines. Intravenous aminocaproic acid is added to the treatment. After 24 hours the bladder was again clotted and the patient continued to be anaemic and haemodynamically unstable, despite having received a transfusion of 10 blood concentrates. In view of this situation, we decided to perform bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (BCN) with the dual intention of solving the obstructive problem caused by bladder obstruction and attempting to reduce bleeding at this level. Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy was performed under general anaesthesia in the Valdivia position, placing 8 Ch catheters through the lower calyx, with no incidences.  Twenty-four hours after bilateral CPN, the patient improved significantly, ceasing haematuria and not requiring new blood transfusions. Two days later, vasoactive amines and orotracheal intubation were withdrawn, and the patient was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit on the fourth day. Once the acute symptoms were over, a new endoscopic examination of the bladder was scheduled with biopsies. The anatomo-pathological study revealed as the only notable alteration the presence of an eosinophilic material around the blood vessels of the submucosa. This substance stained with Congo Red stain and turned apple green under polarised light with birefringence, which confirmed that it was amyloid. The immunohistochemical study of the lesion with monoclonal antibodies (clone mc1), specific against the AA protein of amyloid was positive, allowing the diagnosis of secondary bladder amyloidosis (Type AA). The postoperative period was uneventful, the nephrostomies were removed after 20 days and the patient was discharged after one month.  After 6 months of follow-up, the patient has not presented haematuria again and is awaiting studies to rule out systemic involvement due to amyloidosis.   "
"A 48-year-old man from Argentina with no personal history of interest with progressive enlargement and pain in the left testicle of 2 months' evolution; no urinary symptoms, no fever. He was treated with various antibiotics without improvement. Physical examination revealed a hard tumour on the left testicle that was painless and without signs of fluctuation. Complementary tests: Haemogram: Lymphocytosis, the rest normal. Urine sediment: pyuria. Urine culture: sterile. Semen cultures: E. coli (1st), S. Sprophiticus (2nd), P. Mirabilis (3rd). Tumour markers: CEA, alpha foetus and BHCG normal. Urinary ultrasound: normal. Testicular ultrasound: Heterogeneous left testicular tumour without liquid areas inside. Positive Mantoux test with ulceration. In the absence of clinical and radiological improvement, radical orchiectomy was performed and the pathological study reported non-specific orchitis.  A sample was sent to microbiology, consisting of purulent exudate obtained intraoperatively from the testicular tissue. Auramine staining for mycobacteria was negative. Gram staining showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes and few Gram(+) bacilli, some of them filamentous, with irregular staining and with bulging bacillary ends in the form of maces. Genomic amplification (PCR) for M.tuberculosis was negative. Chlamydia antigen detection was also negative. Culture for usual bacteria, including Neiseria and Haemophilus, were negative at 72 hours of incubation. At 96 hours, growth was detected in the culture of a micro-organism very adherent to the medium, difficult to emulsify, which on Gram staining showed a Gram(+) bacillus morphology of coryneform appearance, sometimes with irregular staining and some with club-shaped terminations. Phenotypic identification did not provide significant data, so genetic study by 16SrRNA sequencing was performed and the strain was identified as Corynebacterium thomsseni. Cultures for Nocardia, mycobacteria and fungi were negative. The isolated strain was highly sensitive to Penicillin, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, Cefotaxime, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Erythromycin, Tetracycline, Trimethoprim sullfamethoxazole, Rifampicin and Imipenem.

"A 38-year-old man, with no past history of interest, came to the urology clinic requesting a vasectomy. The physical examination revealed a normal male subject, with penis, testicles and epididymis of normal size and consistency. The right vas deferens was clearly palpable. This was not the case with the left vas deferens which could not be palpated within the spermatic cord. Rectal examination was unremarkable. In view of the suspicion of vas deferens agenesis, a transrectal ultrasound was performed, in which the left seminal vesicle was not visualised. IVUS revealed the complete absence of the left kidney. Subsequently, an MRI confirmed the absence of the left seminal vesicle, vas deferens and ureter. The patient was scheduled for vasectomy which was performed uneventfully on the right side. Control seminograms performed three months after the operation revealed complete azoospermia, confirming the clinical suspicion of deferential agenesis associated with renal and homolateral seminal vesicle agenesis. The patient's first-degree relatives (two sons, a male brother and his two sons) were advised to undergo an ultrasound study, given the potential autosomal dominant transmission of renal agenesis, and both kidneys were found to be present in all of them. The patient's sweat test was also negative.   "
"A 67-year-old man was admitted to the internal medicine department for constitutional syndrome, anaemia and a mass on the right flank. Personal history of interest includes: cerebrovascular accident in the middle cerebral territory, secondary to atrial fibrillation at 64 years of age; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; regular treatment with oral dicoumarinics and amiodarone. The patient presented with anorexia, asthenia, and a weight loss of 12 kilograms in 4 months. Twenty days prior to admission, sudden pain began in the flank and right renal fossa. The urological history was normal. Physical examination revealed a painful mass in the right hemiabdomen. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests showed normocytic and normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.6) and prolonged ESR; biochemical, urinary and tumour marker tests were normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a right renal mass with a mixed ultrasound pattern measuring 17 x 13 centimetres in diameter, with an extraparenchymal area compatible with haematoma. The full body computed axial tomography (C.A.T.) showed a predominantly solid mixed mass in the upper pole of the right kidney, with probable infiltration of the psoas muscle; no adenopathy or vascular thrombosis was observed. Prior to surgery, and given the large size of the tumour mass, arteriography was performed, selectively embolising the renal artery by means of colis. Three days later, radical nephrectomy was performed via the anterior approach, revealing a large tumour mass dependent on the right kidney, which did not affect the psoas muscle.  Histologically, macroscopically, a tumour mass of 10 centimetres in diameter was observed that affected perirenal fat without affecting the excretory or venous systems. Microscopically it is a very undifferentiated malignant renal spindle cell tumour, Fuhrman grade 4 sarcomatoid type, with perirenal infiltration but with no involvement of the excretory or venous systems; pT3 G3 N0 M0. After surgery, the patient evolved favourably and was discharged on the tenth post-operative day.  At the first check-up, six months after the operation, the control CT scan showed two heterogeneous cystic masses in the retroperitoneal space; the first was adjacent to the psoas muscle and was about 12 centimetres in diameter, with probable infiltration of the liver and ascending colon; the second was 10 centimetres in diameter adjacent to the psoas muscle. Fine needle aspiration puncture (F.N.A.P.) with ultrasound was performed and the result was renal carcinoma metastasis. The full-body bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic lesions.  72 hours after the P.A.A.A.F. the patient presented dizziness, abdominal distension and anaemia, and a blood test was carried out, showing a loss of 5 g/dl of haemoglobin with respect to discharge. The CT scan at that time showed a large retroperitoneal mass, with an intense haemorrhagic component. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, evacuating the retroperitoneal haematoma, and excising the haemorrhagic cystic tumour, adhered to the caudate lobe of the liver, which in the intraoperative biopsy was reported as a high-grade malignant fusocellular tumour, partially cystic, compatible with recurrence of renal tumour, the post-operative evolution of the patient presented a new retroperitoneal haematoma.   "
"54-year-old man, smoker of 30 cigarettes a day. He first consulted the urology department in May 2000 for lower urinary tract infection and left renal colic. Rectal examination revealed a fixed, stony, irregular prostate in both lobes. Ultrasonography shows no alterations of interest, except for an enlarged prostate for his age (prostate weighing approximately 65 grams). The PSA is 223. Prostate biopsy revealed 6 markedly infiltrated cylinders of adenocarcinoma Gleason VII. A staging bone scan was performed, which showed no evidence of bone pathology, and complete androgen blockade with antiandrogens and LH-RH analogues was initiated (August 2000). During follow-up, PSA levels gradually increased (January 2001: 0.5, August 2001: 0.7, February 2002: 6.4, April 2002: 14), without the patient noticing any worsening of his general condition. In February and April 2002, he visited the emergency department for two episodes of haematuria and urinary retention, requiring bladder catheterisation for a month. His obstructive symptoms progressively worsened over two months, reaching the point of almost dribbling urine in June 2002. The urine flow study in May 2002 showed a peak flow of 2 ml/sec, with a residual of 80 ml. Due to this clearly obstructive worsening of his disease, transurethral resection of the prostate was proposed. In July 2002, when the resector was introduced to perform the resection of the prostate, a penile urethra full of 0.5-1 cm polypoid mamelon formations was observed, which made entry into the bladder difficult, as they reduced the urethral calibre and bled when rubbed. The rest of the bulbar and prostatic urethra is normal, the latter being somewhat unstructured. T.U.R. was not performed because it was difficult to see.  In July 2002, after finding a PSA of 22, antiandrogens were withdrawn, keeping the analogues and including the patient in a trial with Atrasentan (M00- 244). The persistence of severe obstructive symptoms justified a resection of the urethral mamelons and the prostate, and both samples were sent separately to the anatomical pathology department to obtain histological affiliation of the urethral mamelons. Bladder catheterisation was maintained for 3 weeks. The histological diagnosis of the urethral tissue was: masses formed exclusively by a Gleason X adenocarcinoma. Regarding the prostate tissue itself, the diagnosis was the same. At present, the patient is in excellent general condition, attending the relevant consultations according to the trial protocol, with no symptoms derived from his illness.  "
"A 35-year-old woman consulted for terminal dribbling or ""drooling micturition"", dyspareunia and repeated urinary tract infections. Intravenous urography and voiding cystography showed findings compatible with urethral diverticulum. The patient had urinary frequency and nocturia 3 to 4 times. Occasionally she had had isolated episodes of stress urinary incontinence, for which she used a daily protective pad. She had urinary urgency and occasional urge incontinence. There was no urinary voiding, no sensation of bladder pressure or incomplete emptying. No haematuria or symptoms or signs of genitourinary cancer. Normal bowel rhythm. No previous female sexual dysfunction until the present dyspareunia affecting her sex life. No neurological pathological history. Medical and surgical history: High blood pressure. Asthma in childhood. Occasional lumbosacral pain. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy 2 years ago. Two caesarean sections, the last one 12 years ago. On antihypertensive treatment with atenolol, chlorthalidone and amlodipine. No known allergies. No diabetes. No smoking or drinking. Physical examination: Morbid obesity. Good general health. Examination of the head, neck and cardio-pulmonary system with no pathological findings. Blood pressure: 140/100. Abdomen soft, obese, not painful, no hepatosplenomegaly. Pelvic examination in dorsal lithotomy position: relatively narrow vaginal introitus; bulge in the suburethral area near the bladder neck and mid urethra approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, fluctuant, compatible with a urethral diverticulum. No pus was obtained on pressure. No stress incontinence was observed.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was performed on axial T1, axial T2, fatty T2 sequences in both right and left images. Two liquid formations were found in the pelvis. The larger one measured 3.4 cm in its longitudinal axis, in the right parasagittal area, the second collection measured 1 cm in its longitudinal axis. The one cm diameter formation had the same characteristics and was located between the parasagittal and mid-sagittal area. A relationship to the urethra could not be documented in the other sequences. The impression was of a large urethral diverticulum, at least 3.5 x 2.5 cm, however, it could not be ruled out that the smaller collection was a Bartholin's gland cyst.  Flexible cystourethroscopy under anaesthesia revealed a large urethral diverticulum 10 mm from the bladder neck. On compression, there was no drainage from the urethra. At cystourethroscopy with 12 and 70 degree optics, two ostia were found in the mid urethra at 7 o'clock cystoscopic time. The ostia were within a few millimetres of each other. The rest of the urethra was unaltered. Macroscopically, the diverticulum did not involve the bladder neck, nor did it deform the trigone. Cystoscopy showed both ureteral orifices to be normal and orthotopic. No alterations were found in the rest of the bladder. The diagnostic impression was of complex urethral diverticulum with two ostia at 7 o'clock cystoscopic time in the middle urethra. A urethral diverticulectomy was indicated. The patient was previously informed of the risks of the procedure, including urethrovaginal fistula, urethral stricture, urinary incontinence and possible subsequent reconstructive surgery. Procedure  General anaesthesia. Lithotomy position. Sterilisation and preparation of the external genitalia field in the usual way. Silk fixation stitches in the labia minora to expose the anterior vaginal wall. Antegrade placement of a 16 French suprapubic cystostomy tube using the Lowsley retractor. The balloon of this catheter was inflated with 7 ml of sterile water and left as a gravity drain for the duration of the operation. Placement of a 16 Fr Foley urethral catheter into the urinary bladder. Cystoscopy was performed confirming the preoperative diagnosis. The anterior vaginal wall was infiltrated with a total of 15 ml of saline containing lidocaine and epinephrine. An inverted U-shaped incision was made and a flap of the anterior vaginal wall was dissected until the periurethral fascia was exposed. A horizontal incision was made in the periurethral fascia and a plane between the urethral diverticulum and the periurethral fascia was carefully dissected. It should be noted that the wall of the diverticulum was very thick and indurated. The diverticulum was dissected down to the level of its own neck. The diverticular neck was sectioned just flush with the urethra, exposing the previously placed Foley urethral catheter. The edges of the urethra were approximated by suturing the urethral mucosa continuously with 3-0 Vycril. In the horizontal plane the periurethral fascia was reapproximated with loose Vicryl stitches. The anterior vaginal flap was used as the final layer. As there was excess anterior vaginal wall tissue overlying the diverticulum, the excess was trimmed and the anterior vaginal incision was closed with continuous 2-0 Vicryl suture. The Foley urethral catheter was left in place and the suprapubic cystotomy was left draining under gravity. It should be noted that dissection of the diverticulum, which was 4 cm in length, was very difficult, mainly due to the difficulty of dissecting the entire length of the diverticulum up to the neck of the diverticulum. Pathology report: Tissue fragment measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm and another tissue fragment measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm compatible with complex urethral diverticulum, with chronic inflammation covering dense connective tissue.

"A 69-year-old man came to us for a check-up for prostatic syndrome in treatment with an alpha-blocker. He had undergone surgery on the right hip, hypoacusis and repeated angina. He had an episode of left costolumbar trauma some 30 years ago. Urological history of haematuria on two occasions, the last time a year ago. On examination, the prostate had fibroadenomatous characteristics, volume II/IV, with no nodulation. On abdominal palpation, there was a large mass located in the left hypochondrium and left void, painful on palpation. Laboratory tests: Hb 14.6 g/dl, Hcto. 43.1%, ESR 9 mm/h and biochemistry within normal limits. PSA: 3.1 ng/ml. Simple X-ray: large mass effect located in the left hypochondrium and left void, ovoid in shape, totally calcified.  In view of these findings, a differential diagnosis with any mass located in the retroperitoneum with this type of calcification is considered: - Primitive retroperitoneal tumours - Adrenal tumours - Renal tumours - Metastatic tumours - Infectious pathology Blood determinations of plasma renin activity before and after ambulation, as well as aldosterone and cortisol at 8 and 20 hours are performed, the results being within normal range. Urine levels of 17-ketosteroids and corticosteroids, as well as catecholamines, metanephrines and vanillylmandelate were normal. All of the above ruled out a functioning adrenal tumour. Stains for acid fast bacilli in urine and sputum were also negative, as was the Mantoux test. The possibility of a calcified hydatid cyst was raised, but serology was negative. The previously suffered left costolumbar trauma was also considered as a possible cause of the calcified adrenal mass. With the diagnosis of a retroperitoneal mass without filiation, exploratory laparotomy was performed, finding a protruding lesion in the left hypochondrium, hard to palpation, with fixation to deep planes and diffuse lesions distributed throughout the peritoneum, with the intraoperative anatomopathological report of peritoneal fat infiltrated by a malignant tumour of probable mesenchymal origin. It was decided to close the abdominal cavity as it was a disseminated malignant process. The definitive pathological report was pleomorphic liposarcoma, with immunohistochemical techniques of: S100: positive; Oil-Red: positive; vimentin: positive; PS 3: positive; desmin: negative.  The patient was discharged on the seventh day after the operation and died two weeks later at home.  "
"A 72-year-old woman with a history of long-standing rheumatoid arthritis treated with NSAIDs and under study for chronic diarrhoea of several months' duration by the Digestology Department of another centre. During a diagnostic colonoscopy, the patient suffered an iatrogenic perforation of the descending colon, for which reason she was urgently referred to our centre. With the diagnosis of intestinal perforation, the patient underwent emergency surgery by the General Surgery on-call team, performing a median laparotomy with primary suture of the descending colon. After intraoperative catheterisation of the patient, there was an immediate appearance of frank haematuria, for which reason we were consulted. After initial assessment of the patient and in the absence of other associated symptoms, conservative management was decided and the patient's progress was monitored. In the hours following the operation, the intensity of the haematuria increased and continuous bladder lavage and intravenous treatment with E-aminocaproic acid was started, which did not resolve the symptoms, leading to progressive anaemia that required the transfusion of six units of red blood cell concentrate in the following days. Subsequently, the intensity of the haematuria subsided, although in the two weeks following the operation, it recurred in the form of self-limiting episodes that partially subsided with conservative measures. Six days after the operation, ultrasound was performed, which showed bladder occupation by an image suggestive of a clot, and cystoscopy, which was inconclusive due to intraluminal occupation by a large clot. During the examination, an attempt at lavage was made, which was unsuccessful due to pain, and only the trigonal area could be explored, revealing a filiform clot protruding from the left ureteral meatus. Imaging tests were requested: intravenous urography showed normality of both ureteropielocaliceal systems, which appeared slightly ectatic due to the presence of multiple intravesical repletion defects suggesting the presence of the known clot. The CT scan provided no further information, with similar findings to the previous examination, ruling out pathology of the upper urinary tract.  Given the persistence of the episodes of haematuria and the emission of clots, an examination was scheduled under general anaesthesia, and after profuse lavage with Ellick, the presence of an excrescent lesion with an apparently tumour-like appearance was observed, which was dropping from the cupula along the entire posterior wall, with only the trigonal-peritrigonal area being spared. Given the suspicion of a bladder tumour, extensive transurethral resection was performed, leaving the lesion flat. The anatomo-pathological study of the material submitted showed the presence of amyloid material distributed around the submucosal vessels, as can be seen in the haematoxylin-eosin staining. The eosinophilic character of this material was also revealed by staining with Congo red. Furthermore, immunohistochemical study of the material, with monoclonal antibodies (clone mcl) specific against the AA protein of amyloid, confirmed that the submucosal perivascular deposits corresponded to AA amyloid which stained characteristically by immunoperoxidase reaction. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of secondary bladder amyloidosis was made.  The patient's post-operative evolution was favourable and she was discharged on the 10th day after the operation and subsequently followed up in our outpatient clinic. The patient is currently being followed up for 30 months, with quarterly cystoscopies during the first year and six-monthly during the second year, with no recurrence of the disease to date. Only focal areas of amyloid material in the mucosa were observed in the first cystoscopic controls, which have not generated any subsequent complications.   "
"A 75 year old patient, diagnosed by chance by routine ultrasound scan of a solid mass in the upper pole of the right kidney. One and a half years later she came to our clinic. She had not followed any treatment. She remained asymptomatic. Radiological examinations Chest PA and L: calcified adenopathies in the mediastinum, presence of an isolated fibrous tract in the left base. Abdominal CT scan: at the level of the upper pole of the right kidney and internally, there is a solid mass of about 5 cm, growing downwards and touching the renal sinus, growing behind the vascular structures.  After administration of contrast, intense uptake is seen, highlighting the presence of a central scar. The contours are clear and the mass appears encapsulated with respect to the renal parenchyma. There are no signs of involvement of the renal vein, nor extension to the perirenal space, nor adenopathy. In conclusion, renal mass to be determined, although with oncocytoma. Bone scan: increased uptake deposits at the level of the 5th lumbar vertebra, and another at the cervical level, compatible with osteodegenerative processes. Treatment and evolution: with the presumptive diagnosis of localised renal adenocarcinoma, a right upper partial nephrectomy was performed. The intraoperative diagnosis classified the tumour as clear cell adenocarcinoma and indicated free resection margins (T1G1). However, the definitive anatomical pathology report states that 'the renal tumour has an apparently thyroid differentiation. The immunohistochemical study seems to confirm the thyroid origin of the tumour, as antithyroglobulin, vimentin, AE3-AE1, CAM5.2, alpha1 antitrypsin, calcitonin, neurospecific enolase and carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies have been used. The cells are positive for antithyroglobulin, CAM5.2 and S-100'. The patient refused complementary examinations and immediate treatment, but after 4 months she began to experience dysphonia and a sensation of a foreign body in the neck. The cervico-thoracic CT scan showed a mass in the left thyroid lobe measuring 5-3-6 cm, growing towards the upper mediastinum, with involvement of the thyroid isthmus, lymphadenopathy measuring 1 cm in diameter in the middle jugulo-carotid group and a large number of nodular lesions in both lung fields, compatible with micrometastasis. Total thyroidectomy and left functional lymph node emptying and total laryngectomy were performed due to local invasion of the neoplasm. The anatomopathological report confirmed the existence of a poorly differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma. He underwent a complementary session with an ablative dose of Iodine-131.  "
"Patient aged 66 years, ex-smoker, with a history of surgery for adenomatous polyp in the colon, inguinal hernia and oesophageal varices, who was admitted to the hospital for a study of chronic microcytic hypochromic anaemia and persistent cough. Blood tests showed haemoglobin of 10.2 g/dl, haematocrit of 33% and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 87. Urine analysis and chest X-ray were normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hyperechoic mass in the cortical part of the right kidney measuring 7 x 5.6 x 6.6 cm, compatible with a solid tumour. Abdominal CT scan showed a right renal mass in the lower pole, suggestive of hypernephroma, 10 cm in diameter, which caused thrombosis of the renal vein and inferior vena cava. There was also evidence of locoregional adenopathy. The extension study showed no evidence of metastasis. With the diagnosis of hypernephroma, an extended right nephrectomy was performed with cavotomy and extraction of the tumour thrombus, as well as interaorto-caval lymphadenectomy. The pathological findings were clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 8 cm in diameter, with tumour invasion of the ureter and renal vein, nuclear grade III/IV. Nuclear grade III/IV. Nodes without tumour involvement (T3bN0). Three months after surgery, the chest X-ray showed multiple nodular images in both lung fields compatible with metastasis. He also presented with radicular pain in the left leg. The patient was treated with Interleukin-2 by the Oncology Service. Six months after surgery, he consulted for the appearance of two irregular, hard nodules, 2-3 cm in diameter, located below the right teste, at the root of the penis. Scrotal ultrasound showed an echogenic, solid, extratesticular mass with small cystic areas measuring 2.3 x 2.5 x 2 cm and another formation of similar characteristics in the penile root measuring 2.8 x 2 cm.  FNA of these lesions was performed and the pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma metastasis. The control CT scan showed a bilateral paravertebral mass infiltrating the vertebra at the C7-D1 level, which required the administration of analgesic radiotherapy. Fourteen months after surgery, he was treated with palliative radiotherapy for spinal cord compression syndrome, and died one month later.  "
"A 66-year-old man was referred by the Gastroenterology Department due to the finding of a 25 cm retroperitoneal mass on abdominal ultrasound performed for dyspepsia. His personal history included: old pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Physical inspection revealed a large mass deforming the right anterior hemiabdomen, extending from the subcostal area to the pubis. On palpation, the mass was painless, firm in consistency, with no signs of peritoneal irritation and dull to percussion. Rectal palpation revealed a prostate of size II/V, adenomatous, smooth and well-defined. Blood tests, urine sediment and urine culture were normal, and the PSA level was 1.2 ng/ml. Abdominal ultrasound showed a cystic lesion 25 cm in diameter, with abundant internal echoes, extending from the lower edge of the liver to the groin. IV urography (IVU) showed distortion of the right renal silhouette and pelvis, with significant displacement of the lumbo-iliac segment of the right ureter, extending beyond the abdominal midline, as well as slight ectasia of the ipsilateral upper urinary tract.  The abdomino-pelvic CT scan performed with oral and intravenous contrast showed a right retroperitoneal polylobulated cystic retroperitoneal mass of 25 cm in cranial-caudal diameter, extending from the subhepatic region to the groin, compressing and displacing the right kidney, the psoas iliacus muscle and the ascending colon, posteriorly and medially. Punctate calcifications were also observed in the cystic wall. In the medial and inferior portion of the mass there was a tubular structure of 2 cm in diameter and 7 cm in length, with progressive tapering in a caudal direction, ending in a complete stop. The right kidney was functionally normal. The CT findings were interpreted as a possible dysplastic right lower kidney with partial agenesis of the ureter.  Given the existing diagnostic doubts with the radiological studies performed, it was decided to perform a percutaneous puncture-biopsy, which was reported as a cystic lesion wall, and urine cytology, which showed no evidence of malignant cells. Subsequently, surgery was performed via a right pararectal approach, showing a cystic mass related at its cranial end to the right hepatic lobe and the lower pole of the kidney, and at its caudal end to the space of Retzius and the internal inguinal orifice. No intra-abdominal organ infiltration was observed. Careful resection of the cystic mass and the cecal appendix, which was in close relation to the caudal portion of the cystic mass, was performed.  Pathological examination of the specimen revealed a dilated appendix, lined by a cytologically benign mucinous epithelium, which formed papillary-like structures. These findings were diagnostic of mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix.  The postoperative course was normal. The IVUS performed three months after surgery showed good bilateral renal function, with lateral hypercorrection of the right ureteral tract and disappearance of the right renal distortion.  At the 20-month check-up, the patient was asymptomatic from the urological point of view, and the control CT scan showed no abdominal lesions suggestive of peritoneal pseudomyxoma.  "
"A 29 year old patient attended the Emergency Department of our Hospital with a mildly painful erection of ten hours' duration. The patient reported having had four similar episodes in the last three months, but in all of them the erection had subsided within three to four hours at most. The patient denies any history of penile trauma, the use of drugs or other medication, including intracavernous injections. There were no other accompanying symptoms such as asthenia, anorexia or fever. Blood gasometry was performed on the blood taken from the corpora cavernosa, obtaining analytical results for venous blood (pCO2 163.1 mmHg, HCO3 13.2 mEq/l plasma). Given this priapism of prolonged duration and the absence of signs of high-flow priapism, we proceed to try to reverse the erection as soon as possible, in order to calm the pain and avoid irreversible damage to the corpora cavernosa. A 19 G intravenous catheter is punctured in both corpora cavernosa, blood is repeatedly aspirated and allowed to drip out. After this first step, no decrease in erection is obtained, so a solution of phenylephrine (alpha-adrenergic agonist) is prepared in saline at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Two ml of the solution is injected into a corpus cavernosum and then compressed. This manoeuvre is repeated again in the contralateral corpus cavernosum. If there is no response, a new phenylephrine solution is made by mixing 10 mg of phenylephrine in 11 mg of saline and 20-30 ml of this solution is injected into each of the corpora cavernosa to wash them. After repeating this last manoeuvre several times, penile flaccidity is finally achieved. During his stay in the emergency department and after achieving flaccidity, blood tests were drawn and revealed a marked increase in the blood leukocyte (414 x 109/L) and platelet (1100 x 109/L) counts. Suspicion of a myeloproliferative syndrome led to consultation with the Haematology Department, which diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia.  The patient subsequently underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from an HLA-identical family donor. The evolution of his haematological disease was favourable and the priapism was completely resolved with the treatment of the chronic myeloid leukaemia and without alteration in sexual potency.  "
"Male infant born at 40 weeks gestation with vaginal delivery and cephalic presentation. Birth weight was 3,700 g and height 47 cm. Urological assessment was requested due to the existence of a large bilateral scrotal enlargement. Physical examination revealed a tension hydrocele in the right hemiscrotal and a mild hydrocele on the left side, with positive transillumination. The left teste was normal in terms of morphology and consistency, but palpation of the right testicle was difficult due to the presence of a tension hydrocele.  Blood tests showed moderate leukocytosis. Urine sediment was normal. Doppler ultrasound was performed by adjusting both the pulse rate and the wall filter to the lowest levels of the ultrasound machine. The findings were bilateral hydrocele, being large on the right side, with the right teste showing preserved arterial Doppler flow, although with an elevated resistance index (RI) (RI=0.82; Normal: 0.48-0.75), absence of venous flow and heterogeneous echogenicity, suggesting areas of destructuring. The left testicle is normal ultrasonographically, presenting a peak systolic velocity of 11 cm/s and diastolic velocity of 5 cm/s, with an IR of 0.55. Given the suspicion of testicular vascular compromise, surgical exploration was decided eighteen hours after birth. We observed a tension hydrocele with no evidence of cord torsion, and the teste had a purplish colour and a necrotic appearance, so orchiectomy was performed.  The postoperative course was without immediate complications. The pathological anatomy of the specimen showed testicular haemorrhagic infarction.  After eight months of follow-up the patient is asymptomatic and the left hydrocele has disappeared.  "
"In July 2000, from the Nephrology Department where he was being studied for chronic renal insufficiency secondary to nephroangiosclerosis, a 77-year-old man was referred to us due to the ultrasound finding of a 6 cm renal mass affecting the left kidney. His personal history included COPD, hypertension and duodenal ulcus with pyloric stenosis. To complete the studies we performed an abdomino-pelvic CT scan, which was reported as an 'infiltrative lesion involving the upper 2/3 of the left kidney with involvement of the pericapsular space and poorly defined borders'. Analytically, the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy with IgM of 4640 g/l (38-231) kappa by immunofixation was very remarkable. Other tests: positive bence-Jones proteinuria, bone marrow aspirate with 12.5% atypia and bone series without lytic lesions.  With the first diagnosis of renal mass associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy (without fulfilling the criteria for IgM myeloma), a radical left nephrectomy was performed in August 2000. The anatomopathological result was primary renal non-hodking B lymphoma of the MALT type (mucosa-associated lymphoid tumour). The patient had a good post-operative evolution and was discharged with outpatient controls. In December 2000 a first control was carried out, showing an IgM of 3430 g/l in a first analysis and 4340 g/l in a second, so it was decided by the Haematology Department to start treatment with Chlorambucil. A control CT scan was performed which was reported as 'thickening of the perirenal fascia with fat deflecting compatible with inflammatory lesions or similar'. As there was no total evidence of recurrence, it was decided to monitor the patient closely with analytical and radiological controls and to maintain treatment with Chlorambucil. In January 2002 a new CT scan was performed and no signs of recurrence were found. Currently the patient continues to be asymptomatic, with stable IgM levels (last control 48 g/l) on treatment with Chlorambucil.  "
"A 60-year-old patient with a history of depressive disorders, with an attempt at self-harm, causing polytraumatism with fracture of the sacrum, right iliopubic branch (2 years of evolution); subsequently presenting with repeated urinary infections, constipation and irritative incontinence. Physical examination revealed atrophic external genitalia, negative Boney test and discrete cystocele. Laboratory tests showed normal biochemistry parameters and preserved renal function. There was a sediment with leukocyturia and bactiuria. The urine culture was contaminated. The urographic study showed good bilateral function, with moderate right pyeloureteral ectasia, lack of bladder repletion and rejection of the bladder.  Abdomino-pelvic scan: spleen, pancreatic area, kidneys with discrete right ureteral ectasia. Giant faecaloma occupying almost the entire pelvis and causing large bladder displacement.  Consultation with the Digestive Unit, where he was admitted for manual removal and evacuating enema therapy; proceed to cleanse the rectum-sigmoid. Subsequent check-ups showed an improvement in her micturition and control of constipation.  "
"We present the case of a 66-year-old male patient with a history of hyperglycaemia on dietary treatment, epididymal tuberculosis (TBC), vocal cord decortication and a smoker of 40 cigarettes/day, who came to the outpatient clinic for an episode of haematuria. Physical examination: good general condition. Rectal examination: grade I-II/IV prostate, elastic consistency, preserved limits. No suspicious areas were observed. Blood tests were performed (haemogram: red blood cells 5.09 million/mm; haemoglobin 15.8 g/dl; haematocrit 47.35%; platelets 250.0 thousand/mm; leukocytes 10.67 thousand/mm (neutrophils 47.10%, lymphocytes 44.9%, eosinophils 1.20%, basophils 0.8%). Coagulation study: no alterations. Biochemistry: no alterations; PSA 2.9) and urine (urine systemic: density 1015; pH 6.5; leucocytes 500/microl; nitrites negative; erythrocytes 10/field. Sediment: abundant leukocytes), with negative urine cytology (intense acute inflammatory component), simple abdominal X-ray showing lithiasis in the lower pole of the left kidney and abdominal ultrasound with normal right kidney, lithiasis in the lower pole of the left kidney and irregular dilatation of the ureter on the same side. At the bladder level, a mass of approximately 1 cm in maximum diameter was observed on the left lateral side. IVUS was performed, showing a left kidney with calyceal dilatation and irregularities all around, dilatation of the ureter on the same side, with tortuous and irregular contours, up to the iliac ureter. In its last 8-10 cm up to the bladder, the ureter has a normal appearance. Cystogram with contour irregularities in its upper portion. Cystoscopy was carried out and a tumour was observed on the left lateral side of the bladder, with a solid appearance and whitish colouring, which prevented the left ureteral orifice from being seen. A Löwenstein urine culture was requested and TUR of the bladder mass was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. PA report: granulomatous tuberculoid cystitis, compatible with TB. Lowenstein urine test: positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Diagnosis of genitourinary tuberculosis with bladder tuberculoma and left renoureteral involvement and tuberculostatic treatment was started (Isoniazid 5 mg/kg/day + Pyrazinamide 30 mg/kg/day + Rifampicin 10 mg/kg/day for 2 months. Isoniazid + Rifampicin at the same doses for the following 4 months). During his follow-up (14 months after diagnosis and after treatment was completed), he developed a fistula with exudate in the left teste, the staining of which did not show any BAAR, with negative Lowenstein. It closed with local dressings. A control testicular ultrasound was performed, showing chronic changes in both epididymides with small bilateral hydrocele. Control IVUS was carried out and showed good evolution, improving the function and morphology of the urinary tract (left). In the last IVU performed (4 years after diagnosis), an alteration in the morphology of the lower pole of the left kidney was observed, with a decrease in the cortical area and associated variegated calcification in the parenchyma, all in relation to her diagnosis of TB. Ureters of normal calibre and morphology. Stress bladder and prostatic hypertrophy. Negative Löwenstein urine cultures were maintained at the end of medical treatment.  "
"A 78-year-old male patient, diabetic on treatment with oral antidiabetics, with a history of renal lithiasis and repeated nephritic colic, and with malignant neoplasia of the neck treated with RT two months earlier, who came to the emergency department for an irritative micturition syndrome with pollakiuria, bladder tenesmus and dysuria of two months' evolution. Two days earlier he had been in the emergency department where he was diagnosed with UTI and antibiotic treatment with Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was started without improvement. Physical examination showed an axillary temperature of 38.2º C. The rest of the examination was completely normal, including a rectal examination which revealed a prostate of size III/IV, not indurated and slightly painful on palpation. The blood test showed a significant leukocytosis of 41800 with neutrophilia (93%), a blood glucose of 337 mg/dl, a platelet count of 394000, a fibrinogen of 771 and a decrease in Quick's Index (68%). Urine sediment showed pyuria and microhaematuria and plain chest and abdominal X-rays showed no pathology. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen was also performed at the emergency department and showed no pathology. With suspicion of UTI, she was admitted to the Urology Department and intravenous antibiotic treatment was started after obtaining a urine culture. The treatment regimen chosen in this case was a combination of ceftriaxone 1 g plus tobramycin 100 mg every 12 hours. On the third day of admission and in view of the patient's clinical and analytical improvement, it was decided to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotherapy, continuing with cefuroxime-axetil. On the seventh day, coinciding with the arrival of the blood and urine cultures taken on admission, which were reported as negative, the patient presented a fever peak of 39ºC and a new rise in the leukocyte count. We decided to reinstate intravenous antibiotherapy and to perform a vesico-prostatic ultrasound scan in which the patient's large prostate (400 cc) was striking.  In view of the suspicion that it could be an acute prostatitis in the context of BPH, it was decided to continue with intravenous antibiotherapy and to schedule a Millin-type adenomectomy when the infectious symptoms had subsided. Despite antibiotic therapy, the evolution continued to be unfavourable, with persistent febrile peaks, so the treatment regimen was changed and levofloxacin i.v. was introduced instead of ceftriaxone, and a fractionated urine culture was requested. Despite the change in antibiotic treatment, the patient continued to present fever and worsening general condition, so it was decided to perform a transrectal ultrasound to rule out the presence of any complications, in which a poorly defined area appeared in the medial and cranial periphery of the right lobe, with heterogeneous echogenicity, although predominantly hypoechogenic, and with an absence of flow in the Doppler method suggestive of prostatic abscess.  In view of the ultrasound findings, it was decided to perform a transrectal ultrasound-guided puncture of the abscess, obtaining about 20 ml of purulent material which was sent to microbiology. The culture of the prostatic exudate and pus were positive for E. coli. Despite the puncture, the patient continued with septic symptoms and reported no improvement, so it was decided to perform a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and rule out complications of the abscess. The CT scan showed an increase in the size of the prostate gland with a multi-tabular liquid collection, located caudally to the gland itself.  In view of the CT findings, and transrectal puncture having failed, it was decided to perform a transvesical prostatectomy. During the operation, after opening the capsule, we were able to appreciate the total destructuring of the gland, with the presence of multiloculations and purulent material inside it, as well as extensive areas of tissue necrosis involving the entire prostatic urethra at the apical level. Pathological anatomy showed two small foci of microacinar adenocarcinoma, far from the limits of resection, with a Gleason 2 + 3 and chronic and acute abscessed prostatitis with extensive areas of necrosis together with nodular hyperplasia.  The postoperative evolution was satisfactory, with a rapid clinical and analytical improvement, and the patient was discharged from hospital 21 days after the operation. Fifteen days after discharge, the patient was seen in our outpatient clinic with stress urinary incontinence. Six months after the operation, the patient continues to have mild to moderate incontinence and requires absorbent pads for daily hygiene. "
"A 43-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department due to sudden left lumbar pain, continuous and incapacitating, without antalgic position or aggravating factors, without irradiation, with approximately 23 hours of evolution. No nausea or vomiting, no macroscopic haematuria or lower urinary tract discomfort. Absence of precordial pain. Hypertension controlled with verapamil. He reported an episode, interpreted as a transient ischaemic attack, approximately eight weeks earlier (not confirmed). No history of cardiac arrhythmia or valvular heart disease. No other previous thromboembolic episodes. No known history of urinary lithiasis. No osteoarticular or respiratory complaints. No cocaine abuse. No history of hepatitis B or C. Medicated with 160 mg/day of verapamil. Physical examination showed diaphoretic, BP 150 / 110 mmHg, 80 beats per minute, rhythmic and wide. Temperature 37.8 ºC. Abdomen painful on deep palpation in the left iliac fossa and flank, with defence, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Decreased RHA. No abdominal murmurs. Negative bilateral renal Murphy. Existence of symmetrical arterial pulses. No perfusion deficit in the extremities. General neurological examination without alterations. Renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities, especially dilatation of the urinary tract. Laboratory tests: Hb15.6 g/dL, Leuc 13,800/µL, Neut 76.1%, Creat 1.4 mg/dL, TGO 104 UI/L, TGP 74 UI/L, LDH 1,890 UI/L. Coagulation parameters showed no alterations. The ECG showed sinus rhythm, with no alterations compatible with acute myocardial ischaemia. An abdominal and pelvic CT scan was requested, which showed the presence of multiple areas without contrast uptake in the left kidney, without morpho-structural alterations, compatible with multifocal areas of ischaemia, with multisegmental distribution, probably of embolic aetiology. No aortic dilatation or renal artery aneurysm. No intra-peritoneal alterations. Taking into account the multi-segmental distribution of the ischaemic process and the duration of discomfort, we decided that there was no indication for invasive manoeuvres. The patient underwent systemic hypo-coagulation with heparin in an attempt to avoid future embolic episodes and appropriate analgesia.  He then underwent multiple examinations in an attempt to identify an embolic focus and the aetiological process. Echocardiography ruled out pathology of the cardiac valvular apparatus or the existence of valvular vegetations. Absence of areas of myocardial dyskinesia. Arteriography showed a perfusion deficit of the lower pole of the left kidney with multiple other less prominent areas showing perfusion deficits as well. No other alterations such as macro/microaneurysms or alterations of the main renal artery or aorta were detected. The study to rule out prothrombotic and vascular disease (lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, ANCA's, detection of cryoglobulins, ANA's, determination of immunoglobulins and complement fractions) was negative. After 15 months of follow-up, we were left without an aetiological diagnosis. The patient remains asymptomatic, with no new episodes of embolism or manifestations of systemic disease. Anti-coagulation therapy has been discontinued. He maintains controlled hypertension with the same dose of verapamil. The last analytical control had a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and GFR of 93 ml/min. The follow-up kinillogram shows a functional deficit of the affected renal unit (differential function 41%).  "
"A 72-year-old patient was admitted for elective surgery for aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and right hypogastric artery. Personal history: right nephrectomy in 1983 for renal cell carcinoma, AHT controlled with amlodipine and old inferolateral AMI with silent heart disease. The DIVAS showed diffuse aortic ectasia and a fusiform aneurysmal dilatation whose neck was 17 mm from the left renal artery, with a 7 mm mural thrombus inside and a maximum lumen size of 35 mm at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery. The aneurysmal dilatation affects both primitive iliac arteries, and a second 13 mm fusiform aneurysm is observed in the right hypogastric artery. Patency of the celiac axis, left renal artery, superior mesenteric artery and occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery was confirmed. The patient underwent surgery and an aortic endoprosthesis (Quantum Cordis®) 36-12 with extension to both iliac arteries and embolisation of the right hypogastric artery. The control renal arteriography was normal. Two hours after the operation, sudden onset anuria was observed, which did not improve with diuretic perfusion. Urgent arteriography (6 h postoperatively) showed total occlusion of the ostium of the left renal artery due to cranial migration of the stent. Urgent revascularisation surgery was decided by means of splenorenal shunt by left posterolateral lumbotomy at the XII rib level. Dissection of the left renal pedicle (1 artery, 1 vein), renal reperfusion by ringer lactate at 4 C and end-to-end anastomosis with the splenic artery (discontinuous stitches of Prolene® 6/0). Reperfusion of the kidney was performed 12 hours after the onset of anuria, with gradual recovery of colour and consistency, maintaining a good pulse at the anastomosis. Spontaneous diuresis reappeared at 48 h, having previously required a haemodialysis session due to hyperkalaemia and acidosis. The control Angio MRI (2 months) showed the permeability of the stent, the absence of endoleaks and stenosis in the splenorenal anastomosis. At present, the patient continues to have well controlled blood pressure with amlodipine and a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dl.   "
"A 68-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension and hypothyroidism came to the emergency department with acute pain in the left hypochondrium, with no history of trauma, of a constant nature, radiating to the epigastrium with approximately 3 hours of evolution, accompanied by dizziness and weakness. Physical examination revealed hypotension and tachycardia that was maintained despite the administration of intravenous fluids; the abdomen was painful, predominantly in the hypochondrium and left lumbar fossa, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) showed the presence of a rounded retroperitoneal tumour measuring approximately 10 x 12 cm in front of the upper pole of the left kidney, vascularised, with irregular contrast uptake and small calcifications inside; in addition, there was an increase in the density of the retroperitoneal space compatible with bleeding. With the aforementioned findings, surgery was performed, revealing a large left retroperitoneal haematoma extending to the midline and the left iliac fossa and a tumour approximately 12 cm in diameter above the upper pole of the left kidney, encapsulated, with active bleeding due to a fissure in it, which was removed, preserving part of the adrenal gland and the left kidney. The evolution is satisfactory. Subsequent evaluation revealed the absence of arterial hypertension and abdominal ultrasound showed no pathological findings. The biopsy described a nodular tumour 10 cm in diameter and weighing 457 grams, reddish in colour with a yellowish peripheral margin, with a microscopic diagnosis of adrenal endothelial pseudocyst.   "
"A 69 year old woman with a personal history of chronic renal failure (CRF) without affiliation, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of 20 years' evolution, on chronic treatment with corticoids. The patient presented with a sudden onset of total anaemic haematuria, haemodynamic compromise, accompanied by significant deterioration of renal function (creatinine 6.9); after orthopaedic knee surgery. The urological ultrasound scan showed normal kidneys, with no alterations in the parenchyma or collecting system; a large bladder clot was observed. After failure of conservative management with saline solution, the patient presented haemodynamic destabilisation, and endoscopic exploration was performed, but it was impossible to extract the clot; given the situation, open surgery was decided, opening the bladder, extracting the clot, and the bladder mucosa was found to be thinned with bleeding in a sheet, with no macroscopic bladder lesions. Random biopsies of the bladder mucosa were taken and reported as bladder amyloidosis with extensive vessel involvement. Treatment with perfused corticosteroids and colchicine. The patient was discharged without haematuria and renal function improved (creatinine 2.3).   "
"A 25-year-old man operated on for a left varicocele six months previously, who consulted for a problem of repeated urinary tract infections without sexual pathology. Retrograde urethrography and voiding cystourethrography showed the presence of an incomplete urethral duplicity originating in the bulbar urethra and running along the ventral side. The accessory tract was surgically resected via the perineal route. Subsequent imaging controls showed the existence of a normal bulbar urethra. Voiding symptoms have not recurred in the two years since the operation.   "
"A 35-year-old man, with a history of lupus, unaffiliated hepatitis and circumcision at the age of 4 years, consulted for bifidity of the urinary stream. On examination, the meatus was normal and there were no fistulas. The penis was larger than normal and the corpora cavernosa were erect, with no involvement of the glans penis.  On cross-examination, he states that he has been in this situation for as long as he can remember and that, as a child, he used to hold his penis with a string around his waist so that his erection would not be noticed. Regarding his sexual activity, he affirms his homosexual choice and his satisfaction with the size of his penis and his permanent erection, which allows him to have successive and indefinite coitus. He has no ejaculation problems. Penile Doppler ultrasound was performed, with time/velocity values in the corpora cavernosa compatible with erection (right cavernous systolic velocity of 51 cm/sec and 41 cm/sec on the left side). Probable arterio-cavernous fistula in the proximal portion of the right corpus cavernosum. MRI angiography demonstrates arterio-cavernous fistula on the right side, which is present in both the arterial and venous phases and confirms the diagnosis of high-flow arterial priapism.   "
"This is a 47-year-old patient whose only pathological history is ankylosing spondylitis with significant loss of mobility of the spine, especially at the cervical level. From the urological point of view, the first contact with the patient was due to the study in August 2001 of a monosymptomatic and capricious haematuria, which after a urographic and ultrasound study led to the diagnosis of a 13 mm papillary neoformation on the left lateral side of the bladder. Based on these findings, an endoscopic resection of the neoformation was performed in November of the same year, with the anatomopathological diagnosis of pTa G1 transitional carcinoma. The patient continued with outpatient follow-up with ultrasound studies and negative urinary cytology. In December 2003, a control cystoscopy was performed and the patient was found to be asymptomatic, with a diagnosis of papillary tumour recurrence, superficial in appearance, in the bladder floor. The preoperative study was normal, with a urine sediment of 35 red blood cells/field and 100 leukocytes/field, with a urinary pH of 7 and a negative culture for usual germs. Three months later, endoscopic resection of the recurrence was performed, which was multifocal, with a diagnosis of pTaG1 transitional carcinoma. Given the age of the patient, the recurrence in less than two years, and the multifocal nature of the recurrence, it was decided, despite the low tumour grade, to complete the treatment with intravesical instillation of Mitomycin C. A weekly instillation of 40 mg of Mitomycin C was scheduled for six weeks, after instillation of an early dose within 48 hours of surgery. Tolerance to the instillations was good and the patient was followed up again in the consultation room. As the patient was asymptomatic, he was seen for a check-up in September 2004 with suspicious but not malignant cytology and the ultrasound finding of a significant thickening of the anterior bladder wall, with abscessation, suggestive of cystitis. In addition, in the area of the last tumour resection there is also a hyperechogenic area with a relief of 1.5 cm at the base of the implantation, highly suggestive of tumour recurrence. Image 1 The urine culture was negative at that time, with a urinary pH of 8, and in the sediment 40 red blood cells/field and 120 leukocytes/field. In October 2004 an endoscopic revision was performed under general anaesthesia. The surgical findings were as follows: - Normal bladder capacity - Deflected area with granulation tissue on the anterior aspect of the bladder, the abscessed image of the ultrasound disappeared. - On the left lateral side of the bladder floor there is a pseudomembrane with a necrotic appearance that detaches when it rubs against the resector. - Under the pseudomembrane there is a very thickened, deflected and very hard mucosa with a feeling of calcification over an area of 2 cm. The lesion described was resected to its full extent with the suspicion that it was an infiltrative neoplasm with areas of necrosis due to its endoscopic appearance. The pathological examination revealed fragments of the bladder wall with intense inflammation, areas of necrosis and deposits of inorganic salts intermingled with necrotic tissue and fibrin, with no evidence of tumour tissue. Smooth muscle fibres with intense inflammation and areas of haemorrhage and necrosis were also observed, but no tumour infiltration was evident. Image 2 The postoperative period was uneventful, and with the diagnosis of encrusting cystitis, the patient was discharged three days after the operation for periodic follow-up in consultation.  "
"A 60-year-old male patient, smoker, severe alcoholism, with a history of arterial hypertension and an episode of acute enolic pancreatitis in November 2003. On admission, an abdominal CT scan was performed which showed diffuse pancreatic inflammation with exudates, as well as the presence of two tumours in the anterior leaflet of the left kidney, one of them with tomodensitometric characteristics suggesting a haemorrhagic cyst or with a high protein content, without being able to rule out a solid tumour. After recovery from the acute inflammatory symptoms, the case was discussed with us, and we continued the study of the tumour by performing a new control abdominal CT scan in February 2004, observing the persistence of both renal lesions. Given the radiological characteristics of the tumour, we indicated surgical intervention. On 29 March 2004, we performed a left renal lumpectomy via lumbotomy. The result of the pathological anatomy of the specimen was a steatonecrotic granuloma with abundant ferric pigment, characteristic of fat necrosis secondary to pancreatitis.  "
"A 38-year-old man, with hepatitis B as the only personal history of interest, presented with a picture of pollakiuria and bladder urgency of 11 months' duration accompanied by terminal haematuria without clots. On physical examination, the abdomen was soft and depressible with no visceromegaly or other abnormalities. On rectal examination, the prostate had a volume of I/IV, was elastic, ill-defined and almost flat. Genitalia were normal. Blood tests with haemogram, biochemistry, coagulation and PSA within normal parameters. Urinalysis with pH 5.5. Urine sediment with 15-20 leucocytes/field and abundant mucus. Urine culture was sterile. Urine cytology was negative for malignant tumour cells and renal, bladder and prostate ultrasound found no alterations, the prostate being homogeneous, with well-defined contours, measuring 17 x 20 mm. Intravenous urography showed normal kidneys and ureters, and a displacement of the bladder to the left and above by a subvesical pelvic mass (with no appreciable bladder filling defects). Cystourethrography showed extrinsic bladder compression.  Cystoscopy showed no endovesical changes. The abdominal-pelvic CT scan showed a large pelvic mass anterior to the bladder, measuring 12 cm in diameter, with well-defined contours, which displaced the bladder backwards and to the left, and the bowel loops cranially, with a fatty plane separating the mass from the bladder. After contrast administration the mass became denser.  Since its origin was not clear, MRI was performed, confirming that it measured 8x12x13cm, well defined, located in front of the bladder and rejecting the bladder to the back and to the left. The mass formed lobulations and was delimited by a thin capsule. The diagnostic suspicion on MRI was fibroadenoma of the urachus due to its lobulated appearance and the presence of fibrous tissue with nodular areas that were enhanced by the injection of IV contrast.  The FNA diagnosis was 'morphologically benign tumour, probably adenomatoid'. In view of the findings described above, it was decided to remove the tumour. On bimanual palpation, the mass was mobile on prostatic compression. Through a median infraumbilical incision and extraperitoneal access, a pelvic mass was identified to the right of the bladder, which appeared to be dependent on the anterior prostatic aspect. After opening the endopelvic fascia, the thin prostatic pedicle on which the mass was dependent was sectioned. Intraoperative biopsy was reported as malignant epithelial tumour with intense reactive fibrosis. Prostatectomy was not performed pending a definitive diagnosis, as macroscopically it appeared benign.  The histopathological study described, macroscopically, a nodular tumour with a smooth surface measuring 12.5 x 12.5 x 7 cm, weighing 50 g. One of its edges was covered by a small, irregularly shaped lump. On one of its edges there was a thin pedicle 0.7 mm long. Microscopically it was composed of a proliferation of spindle cells without atypia in variable numbers, adopting in some areas a haemangiopericytoid-like pattern, associated with a large differentiation of thick collagen bundles predominating in the tumour. There were very isolated foci of atypical cells with <4 mitoses/10 high magnification fields. The pedicle had arterial and venous structures surrounded by connective tissue within which nests with fibroblastic differentiation were identified. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD34, D99 and vimentin, focally positive anti-desmin and broad spectrum keratins, negative cytokeratin 7, EMA, actin, enolase, S-100, chromogranin and p53. The tumour proliferation index expressed by Ki67 was less than 1%. The definitive diagnosis was solitary fibrous tumour. After three years of follow-up the patient has no recurrence of the disease on MRI and is asymptomatic.  "
"We present the case of a 41-year-old patient who consulted for pain and dorsal induration of the proximal third of the penis, which had been present for a week. His personal history included smoking 20 cigarettes a day and excision of cysts in both breasts. There were no coagulation disorders or diseases of interest. The patient reported that for a week he had been experiencing pain on the dorsum of the penis at the root where he felt an indurated and mobile nodule. Physical examination of the external genitalia was normal, except for the painful palpation of the nodule described. Doppler ultrasound was performed, showing a dorsal induration corresponding to segmental thrombosis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis, the rest of its course being permeable.  The patient was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics for four weeks, with clinical improvement in pain and reduction of the induration. A pelvic MRI scan was also requested at six weeks, which showed no evidence of lesions suggesting thrombosis or any other type of pathology in the location of the dorsal penile vein.   "
"Female newborn with normal pregnancy and delivery. Clinical examination revealed a tumour 1 cm in diameter in the introitus, hard on palpation, located slightly to the right of the urethral meatus, displacing the latter as well as the vaginal introitus. The lesion had a cystic appearance with a slightly yellowish colour. With the diagnosis of suspected ureterocele, an ultrasound scan was requested: neither duplicity nor urinary dilatation was found. The perineal ultrasound confirmed the cystic nature of the lesion, confirming the diagnosis of a paraurethral cyst of Skene. A wait-and-see approach was adopted, and the lesion gradually decreased in size during follow-up, reaching a size of 5 mm at 2 weeks, with the tumour disappearing completely by one month of age. No sequelae were described in the patient.   "
"The patient was a 56-year-old male, with no personal history of interest, who consulted for self-limited episodes of monosymptomatic macroscopic haematuria of 2 months' duration. On rectal examination, the prostate was well-defined and adenomatous in consistency (grade II/IV). The following complementary examinations were performed: - Blood count, biochemistry, urine culture, urine cytology and sediment: within normal limits. PSA: 1.46 ng/ml. - Urological ultrasound: bilateral renal sinus cysts. Normal bladder. - Intravenous urography: pyelocaliceal distortion due to the aforementioned cysts. Patent ureters. Normal bladder. Post-myocardial film showed the presence of a 'contrast leakage' into the abdominal cavity. - Cystoscopy: small solid mass located in the bladder dome.  In view of these findings, transurethral resection (TUR) of the lesion was performed, with the histopathological result of adenocarcinoma infiltrating the bladder wall. Following this diagnosis, an extension study was performed using chest X-ray (which was reported as normal) and abdominopelvic CT scan, showing a tubular structure extending from the bladder dome to the umbilicus with a thick wall, especially near the bladder (persistent urachus with possible infiltration of the wall by the tumour) and a moderate amount of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity.  One week before definitive surgical treatment, the patient was admitted with a high fever accompanied by micturition symptoms, abdominal pain, vomiting and anorexia. On physical examination, the patient showed abdominal distension with some degree of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia. After initiating broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic treatment, the patient's symptoms improved, except for the abdominal distension. Abdominal ultrasound showed a large amount of ascitic fluid with septa. With a suspected diagnosis of urachal adenocarcinoma, a wide partial cystectomy was performed, including the bladder dome, a large mass at the level of the urachus and umbilicus, as well as a pelvic lymphadenectomy. During surgery, we observed a large amount of mucoid material infiltrating the entire peritoneal cavity (several samples were taken from different locations for histological study). The anatomopathological diagnosis of the surgical specimen was mucinous adenocarcinoma of the urachus with extension to the urinary bladder and peritoneum. The histological report of the mucoid material sent was pseudomyxoma peritonei.  At present, after 1 year of follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic and with a disease-free extension study.   "
"A 35-year-old male patient with no pathological history of interest, except for a significant smoking habit (20-30 cigarettes/day for more than 10 years). He came to the urologist referred by his general practitioner after suffering an episode of self-limited frank haematuria. Subsequently, the patient presented with further episodes of small clots together with severe irritative voiding syndrome with repeatedly negative urine cultures. Initially, ultrasound and intravenous urography showed a tumour at the level of the bladder trigone, 3 cm in diameter, with mild left ureteral ectasia. Renal function was normal (Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL, plasma urea: 42 mg/dL). Rectal examination revealed a certain increase in prostatic and bladder floor consistency. In view of the diagnosis of a primary bladder tumour, the need for transurethral resection was suggested to the patient. Intraoperative cystoscopy confirmed the presence of a sessile bladder neoplasm, measuring 2-3 cm, with a bullous and ulcerated surface located over the trigonal area. The anatomopathological result reported the presence of a neoplasm consisting of small undifferentiated cells, distributed in ""single file"", with some isolated foci of transitional carcinoma, PSA (-) without being able to determine the precise origin of the tumour. The infiltration affected submucosa and muscle and the resection base was positive for tumour. Pending the results of complementary anatomopathology and extension studies in anticipation of a possible cystectomy, 36 days after resection, the patient was admitted for a severe constitutional syndrome, with weight loss of 10-12 kg, pain in both renal fossae with bilateral grade II/IV hydronephrosis due to ureteral trapping and obstructive renal failure (Creatinine 6.2 mg/dL, Urea: 176 mg/dL, K+:5.6 mEq/L). Urinary bypass was performed urgently, percutaneous nephrostomy type, with rapid restoration of renal function, but during admission a new episode of macroscopic haematuria began. Cystoscopy revealed a large sessile tumour at the base of the bladder with infiltration of both ureteral meatus. Bimanual palpation revealed an irregular induration of the bladder floor that appeared to infiltrate the prostate. An extension study was requested with a simple chest X-ray, abdomino-pelvic CT scan and bone scan. At this time no distant metastatic disease was observed, only thickening of the bladder floor, with bilateral uretero-pelvic-calyceal ectasia and absence of adenopathies.  In view of these findings, a radical cystoprostatectomy with an Indiana-type continent reservoir was performed. During the operation, it was difficult to free the bladder floor due to its infiltration by the tumour. The anatomopathological result confirmed the presence of an undifferentiated small cell carcinoma, with immunohistochemical staining: cytokeratin (+), neuronal specific enolase (NSE) and Chromogranin (-), together with small foci of transitional carcinoma. The tumour affected the full thickness of the bladder wall, right perivesical and periureteral fat, rectal wall, prostate, seminal vesicles and 2 of the 8 nodes of the left common iliac (Stage:T4N2M0). The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged one week after the operation.  Given the high risk of recurrence of the disease, given the involvement of the surgical edges and the presence of adenopathies, the tumour committee of our centre decided to carry out adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. CDDP chemotherapy with concomitant radiotherapy on the pelvis with a dose of 50 Gy, at a rate of 180 cGy per session, 5 times a week, and subsequent overimpression with another 14.4 Gy, was established. The patient's tolerance to this treatment regimen was optimal. Three months after the operation and during the administration of the QT/RT, he came to the clinic with discomfort in the right hemiabdomen radiating to the back with no other associated symptoms. The control abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed a reservoir with good capacity, small dilatation of the right renal pelvis, with no evidence of collections or signs of tumour recurrence. Three months later, the patient presented epigastralgia with irradiation towards both hypochondria, a feeling of immediate postprandial distension and heartburn. Physical examination revealed a mass at the level of the right hypochondrium-vacuum, and ultrasound did not reveal a possible tumour recurrence at this level. A gastroscopy was requested, which showed a retained stomach with extrinsic pyloro-duodenal stenosis, raising the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the tumour versus possible stenosis secondary to radiotherapy. In view of these findings, surgery was decided upon, and during the course of the operation, the presence of tumour recurrence in the right flank, invasion of the duodenum by the tumour and multiple neoplastic implants in the omentum, peritoneum and other serosae were observed, and palliative gastrojejunostomy was performed. After the postoperative period, the patient was sent home for palliative care and died one month after discharge (7 months after the cystectomy and 9 months after diagnosis).   "
"A 50-year-old man with a history of lumbar spine fixation due to herniated discs, who presented with coralliform lithiasis in the right renal pelvis, scarcely radiopaque, with pyelocaliceal dilatation and delayed elimination in the IVUS. Alkalinising treatment was administered with potassium citrate (Acalka) at a dose of one tablet every 8 hours for 3 months and a double J catheter was placed on the right. Subsequently, three sessions of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy were scheduled and IVUS was requested after the treatment, showing a functional annulment of the affected renal unit despite the placement of the double J catheter.  To assess the functional status of the right kidney, an isotopic renogram and renal scintigraphy were performed with low isotopic uptake in the right kidney and a flat, obstructive curve after administration of the diuretic in the renogram. Total renal function of the right kidney was 9%. A right ureteroscopy was performed under anaesthesia in an attempt to identify the origin of the renal annulment. During the procedure, a long lumbar and iliac ureteral stenosis (8-10 cm) with no appreciable lithiasis was observed. A standard guide wire (Cordis, 150 cm long and 0.90 mm wide with a polytetrafluoroethylene coating) was advanced to the kidney and repeatedly dilated with a high-pressure pneumatic balloon (18 atmospheres) without resolving the ureteral stricture, given that during the dilatations the working guide wire was dragged with the balloon to a more distal position, a safety guide wire was also placed and advanced to the renal pelvis to prevent its displacement. Once the attempts at ureteral dilatation had been completed, it was decided to place a double J catheter, which ascended without any problems through the working guide. However, on attempting to remove the guidewire, it was observed that the intrapyelic loop had formed a knot that prevented it from being removed.  At this point, the patient was presented with two therapeutic options: percutaneous approach to remove the loop or nephrectomy, given the limited functionality of the right kidney and the long ureteral stricture, which was difficult to resolve with conservative measures. The patient opted for the second option, performing a right nephrectomy without significant operative incidences, and the patient was asymptomatic in successive visits to the outpatient clinic.   "
"This is a 68-year-old male referred from his outpatient clinic for bilateral obstructive uropathy, in intravenous urography, performed for the study of haematuria. His past history included dyslipidaemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, acute myocardial infarction and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He reported three episodes of haematuria in December 2001, August 2002 and January 2003, self-limited, asymptomatic and without clots. Physical examination showed the patient to be in good general condition, with a globular, soft, depressible abdomen, without masses or megaliths, not painful on palpation. Rectal examination revealed a palpable prostate compatible with benign hyperplasia grade III/IV. Complementary analytical tests Blood count: parameters within normal limits. Blood biochemistry: glucose 145 mg/dl. The rest of the parameters were within the limits of normality. PSA 9.09 PSAl 1.43 index 15.73. Systematic urine study: pH6.5, density 1,016, negative for proteins, ketone bodies, bilirubin, nitrites, urobilinogen and leukocytes, 0.50 g/l of glucose and 50 µl of blood. Urine sediment: 1-2 red blood cells per field. Benign cytology (negative for malignancy). Imaging techniques Plain abdominal X-ray: Calcifications in the lower pelvis of possible vascular origin. Good distribution of intestinal gas. Visible psoas lines. IVUS: Kidneys of size, shape and location within the limits of normality. Bilateral and symmetrical renoureteral elimination with dilatation of the left renal collector, upper-middle third of the left ureter with image of decreased calibre at the level of the pelvic region that may be related to radiolucent calculi. The right renal collector shows no alteration, and at the level of the pelvic ureter there is a repletion defect possibly related to radiolucent calculus or clot. Cystography shows an irregular bladder, suggestive of trabeculations with a marked prostatic imprint. Left percutaneous pyelography: Hydronephrosis with passage of contrast to the bladder, showing a repletion defect at the level of the pelvic ureter, about 5 cm from the bladder.  Abdominal-pelvic CT scan: Moderate bilateral hydronephrosis (26 cm in the right renal pelvis and approximately 29 cm in the left, in the transverse axis). In both distal ureters, approximately 5 cm away from the urinary bladder, intraureteral content is observed, with soft tissue density, suggestive of bilateral urothelioma, occupying practically the entire lumen of the ureters, although without totally occluding them, and occupying an approximate length of 2 cm. The rest of the abdomino-pelvic structures showed no apparent alterations.  Pelvic MRI: Dilatation of the left kidney without being able to identify the exact cause of the stenosis. Treatment By means of a transperitoneal midline laparotomy, ureteral tracts from the lumbar to the juxtavesical area were exposed, revealing two intraureteral masses, mobile, approximately 2 cm in length, with periureteral tissues of normal appearance. A bilateral longitudinal ureterotomy was performed, revealing two papillary neoformations with a pedunculated implantation base, and it was decided to remove them. Placement of pig-tail and closure of the urethrotomy. Pathological anatomy Macroscopic description: Irregular white-pinkish fragment measuring 3x2.5x1.2 cm on the left and 3x2.5x1.2 cm on the right. When cut, a central axis can be seen in both. Microscopic description: The tumours in both ureters have a similar appearance. They correspond to papillary urothelial carcinoma, of low cytological grade, with connective-vascular axes lined by multiple rows of urothelium with slight pleomorphism and exceptional mitoses. Both have a centred muscle-vascular axis, free of tumour infiltration, although in some areas the tumour contacts the muscle apparently without underlying chorion. The resection base with signs of fulguration, free. At the level of the left tumour, there is papillary proliferation on one of its edges, while the opposite one preserves urothelium without significant dysplasia. On the right side, both edges appear to be free, although in one of them there is a remaining papillary fulgurated tumour attached. Final diagnosis Papillary urothelial carcinoma G1 stage difficult to assess, probably T1. Clinical course The patient was discharged after 14 days of hospitalisation, during which he presented febrile symptoms secondary to right basal pneumonia that responded satisfactorily to antibiotic treatment. He also presented with paralytic ileus, which recovered after the application of conservative measures. She attended 10 days later for pig-tail removal without any complications. At his first check-up after surgery, three months later, the patient was asymptomatic from the urological point of view, presenting normal intravenous urography.  "
"A 56-year-old male patient with a history of positive serology for HIV and Hepatitis B presented with acute cholecystitis for which he underwent emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the late postoperative period, one month after surgery, the patient presented a bilioma which was percutaneously evacuated. A biliary bypass is also performed by means of endoscopic cholangiography. As a result of the above, the patient presented with acute pancreatitis associated with a peri-pancreatic collection. This collection was evacuated by means of an initial percutaneous drainage, which proved to be insufficient and the patient presented with a large retroperitoneal collection. With no improvement, and with persistent drainage debit associated with fever and deterioration of general condition, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. This showed encapsulated fluid with a hydro-aerial level in the right flank adjacent to the abdominal wall, extending 17 cm in the cranial-caudal direction and 11 x 3 cm in transverse diameter.  With a diagnosis of extraperitoneal right parietocolic abscess, drainage was performed by lumboscopy, evacuating abundant necrotic and purulent material. Two pure silicone drains were placed opposite each other, creating a continuous lavage system, using slow-drip physiological solution.  The patient evolved favourably with few febrile registers. He had a positive culture for Pseudomona aureaginosa, which was treated with Meropenem during hospitalisation. On the fourth postoperative day, continuous lavage was replaced by a haemosuctor system and he was discharged. During follow-ups, the patient remained afebrile and the drain was removed after cessation of drainage.   "
"Male, 57 years old. With a history of right nephroureterectomy for transitional cell carcinoma in 1991 and radical cystoprostatectomy with Bricker-type urinary diversion in 1995 (pTis No Mo, performed due to BCG-refractory bladder carcinoma in situ). He came to our clinic to assess the possibility of converting his urinary diversion, as he presented stoma prolapse and reported that his life was very limited by the external self-adhesive device. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan was requested as a restaging study, and no signs of tumour activity were found. His baseline creatinine was 1.5 mg/dl. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed in May 2003, with complete dissection of the pelvis, identifying the urethral stump with a Benique. The urethral stump was resected and intraoperative biopsy ruled out tumour infiltration. The neobladder (Studer) was constructed after exteriorising 45 cm of terminal ileum through the stoma orifice. The urethra-neobladder anastomosis was performed laparoscopically. The total operative time was 480 minutes, with an estimated bleeding of 100 cc. The patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day without complications.  The evolution since then (29 months) has been favourable, with no evidence of metabolic alterations or signs of recurrence of the baseline disease.  "
"We present the case of a 43-year-old male, with no known drug allergies or medical or surgical history of interest, with an abdominal gunshot wound (pistol with 9 mm parabellum projectile). The patient was admitted to the emergency department in haemodynamically stable condition, with severe abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed the bullet entry wound in the left iliac fossa and exit through the left buttock, with abdominal pain and signs of peritoneal irritation mainly in the hypogastrium and left iliac fossa. No involvement of the external genitalia or urethrorrhagia was observed. After urethro-vesical catheterisation, intense macroscopic haematuria was observed. The only notable finding in the admission analysis was anaemia (Hb: 9.2 g/dl), with the rest of the biochemical parameters, blood count and coagulation being normal. Given the patient's haemodynamic stability, it was decided to complete the study by means of imaging tests prior to surgery. Given the theoretical trajectory of the projectile (once the entry and exit orifices were known), with the suspicion of bladder injury by firearm and given the possible involvement of other organs, it was decided to perform abdominal-pelvic CT and CT-cystography (by gravity bladder repletion with 300 cc of diluted contrast material). - Abdominal-pelvic CT and cystographic CT: extraperitoneal, left lateral-postero-lateral bladder rupture, with extravasation of contrast after filling. Minimal dilatation of the left collecting system. Entry wound in the left iliac fossa with areas of haemorrhage in the mesosigm, left lateral vesical side, left seminal vesicle and left perirectal and ischiorectal areas.  With these findings, exploratory laparotomy was decided. With the patient in the supine decubitus position, a supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy was performed. Initially, a small perforation in the mesosigm was repaired without affecting the sigmoid loop and a minimal lesion was repaired at the level of the left primitive iliac vein, subsequently verifying the indemnity of the rest of the iliac arterial and venous axis. An anterior longitudinal median cystotomy was then performed and a double bladder perforation was observed, corresponding to the entrance (4 cm in the bottom of the bladder) and exit (1-2 cm, in the left retromeatic region) of the projectile. After exploring the indemnity of the left distal ureter with a 5F ureteral catheter, it was found that the intramural portion was completely disinserted and that the projectile had also severed the left vas deferens. It was decided to suture the double bladder perforation in two planes, after debridement of the devitalised edges, and to perform ureteral reimplantation with a transvesical technique and double J catheter (26 cm/6 F) in the posterior wall, after distal ureteral release and section of the damaged end. After closure, also in a double plane, of the anterior longitudinal cystotomy, a urethro-vesical catheter and double closed suction drainage were left: one intraperitoneal and the other extraperitoneal, separated from the bladder suture line. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotherapy was prescribed: Ceftriaxone 2 grams every 24 hours and Metronidazole 1.5 grams every 24 hours, and the initial postoperative period was favourable. On the 5th day the patient presented deterioration of the general condition, hypotension, fever and leukocytosis with marked left deviation (31% of the keys). Empirical antibiotic therapy was replaced, pending the results of the blood cultures, with Imipenem 500 milligrams every 6 hours intravenously, and the patient improved significantly both clinically and analytically. In the blood cultures, an E. coli producing extended-spectrum b-lactamase, sensitive to Imipenem, grew. A new abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed, which only showed post-surgical changes, ruling out the existence of liquid collections that could have caused the septic condition. The rest of the postoperative period was uneventful, with initial removal of both drains and, on the 10th day, the urethro-vesical catheter. Finally, the patient was discharged after completing 10 days of intravenous antibiotherapy. It was replaced by Ciprofloxacin 250 milligrams every 12 hours orally, according to the previous antibiogram, until the JJ catheter was removed. One month after the operation, the patient returned to our department for urethro-cystoscopy and removal of the JJ catheter. It was observed that the double bladder wound was completely healed, with the suture of the mucosal plane almost completely reabsorbed. The JJ catheter that was tutoring the ureteroneocystostomy is removed endoscopically without any problems. Currently, three months after the operation, the patient is urologically asymptomatic.   "
"23-year-old male diagnosed with hyperrefléxic bladder secondary to myelomeningocele. He had a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus. Despite medical treatment, the patient presented with symptoms of total urinary incontinence, with the need to use a penile collector, as well as recurrent pyelonephritis predominantly on the right side. The cystography showed the presence of a scalloped bladder with a low capacity and a right grade III passive and left grade I active vesicoureteral reflux. The cystography data were confirmed by the urodynamic study. Laparoscopic enlargement enterocystoplasty was performed with a 15 cm detubularised ileal segment. The duration of surgery was 6 hours. Haemorrhage was about 100 cc. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged from hospital on the ninth postoperative day. After 18 months of follow up, the patient is in a continent state and has not had any new episodes of pyelonephritis. The cystography performed 6 months after surgery showed disappearance of the right passive and left active reflux. Only the persistence of a right grade I active reflux was evidenced.  "
"This is a 70-year-old male patient, who was admitted to the emergency department of the Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, with symptoms of approximately one hour of evolution consisting of chest tightness, general malaise, asthenia and diaphoresis; which began after having ingested 100 mg of sildenafil, denies ingestion of another sexual stimulant or cocaine and without sexual intercourse after its consumption. The patient's only clinical history was arterial hypertension, pharmacologically controlled, and he denies previous episodes of angina or nitrate consumption. The clinical examination and vital signs were normal; however, after the initial assessment he presented cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation with response to a single defibrillation of 200 joules. The initial electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the inferior (II, III and aVF) and anterior (V2-V4) leads with reciprocal changes in aVL, with no electrocardiographic extension to the right ventricle.  Cardiac enzymes on admission revealed a creatine kinase (CK) of 170 and a creatine phosphokinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) of 6. Electrolytes, coagulation tests and blood cell counts were normal. Initial management was with aspirin 100 mg, lovastatin 40 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg every 12 hours, enoxaparin 60 mg every 12 hours, oxygen at 3 lt/min and streptokinase 1'500,000 units administered over 30 minutes. No changes secondary to reperfusion were demonstrated. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, where episodes of complete A-V block with spontaneous resolution were documented during the first hours of evolution. The EKG taken at 24 hours of evolution revealed QS in the inferior face and a late progression of the R wave in the anterior face. Enzyme monitoring showed increased CK and MB fraction at 6 hours (4476 and 165) and 12 hours (3839 and 136). The next day coronary angiography showed diffuse disease of the anterior descending artery with 50% lesion in the distal third and 40% lesion in the proximal third of the first diagonal branch. The circumflex artery had a 50% lesion in the middle third and diffuse disease of its obtuse marginal branches. The right coronary artery had an irregular lesion suggestive of a partially resolved thrombus producing a maximum stenosis of 50%; distally the posterior descending artery had two 40% lesions.  The patient evolved satisfactorily without further complications and pain-free. He was discharged for outpatient follow-up.   "
"A 25-year-old man, with no personal history of interest, consulted for a tumour in both testicles of two weeks' evolution. Physical examination: Hard mass occupying more than half of the left testicle. Right testicle increased in consistency, especially in the posterior part. Complementary examinations: - Scrotal ultrasound: Solid tumour measuring 37x21 mm, hypoechoic in the right testicle. Two solid lesions in the left teste measuring 32x17 mm and 7 mm with similar ultrasound characteristics to those found in the right teste. All compatible with bilateral multicentric testicular neoplasia. Left varicocele.  - Tumour markers: AFP: normal; ß-HCG: 6.15 mIU/ml (normal value: < 2.5 mIU/ml); LDH: normal. Surgical treatment: bilateral radical orchiectomy via the inguinal route. The patient ruled out the possibility of prosthesis placement. Histological diagnosis: seminoma with high mitotic index and vascular invasion (pT2) in both testicles (anaplastic seminoma).  Extension study (thoracoabdomino-pelvic CT): adenopathic growths at retroperitoneal level (N2) and hepatic metastatic lesions (M1). Complementary treatment: systemic chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin (4 cycles). Currently, after 24 months of follow-up, there are negative tumour markers with absence of retroperitoneal adenopathies and liver metastases (complete remission). The patient declined the possibility of semen freezing prior to radical surgery.   "
"This is a 66-year-old diabetic woman with a history of hepatitis C virus of post-transfusion aetiology. In January 2006 she presented with a persistent voiding syndrome which did not respond to treatment and she underwent cystoscopy with subsequent TUR. She was diagnosed with pTa G3 bladder carcinoma and started treatment with intravesical BCG. The follow-up TUR at the end of BCG treatment detected the presence of multiple foci of carcinoma in the bladder, confirming the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma invading the muscular layer (pT2 G3). In July 2006 she underwent a radical cystectomy with urinary diversion by means of a Mainz II type ureterosigmoidostomy. The pathological anatomy showed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with invasion of the muscular layer and involvement of one of the resected lymph nodes, a pT2a N1. No distant metastases were detected. Two weeks after the operation, he presented with disorientation and a tendency to sleep in the context of a condition compatible with a urinary tract infection. After 24 hours of observation, intravenous hydration and antibiotic therapy, she recovered and was discharged on oral antibiotics. Ten days later she returned to the hospital with the appearance of dyspraxia, a tendency to sleep, incoherent speech and drowsiness. During the episode she also presented a febrile peak of 38.5ºC. Biochemistry and haemogram were normal (no leukocytosis or neutrophilia). An abdominal ultrasound scan identified moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and a CT scan of the brain was normal. During her admission, and after initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and fluid therapy, the confusional picture gradually resolved until complete recovery. A few days later, the patient again presented cognitive deterioration. On this occasion, the onset of the central symptoms had been similar, with dyspraxia, sudden difficulty in performing daily tasks, somnolence and obtundation, but on this occasion she came to the hospital in a coma, with a Glasgow Glasgow Glasgow score of 8. Laboratory tests showed only moderate hyperglycaemia and slightly elevated transaminases. An electroencephalogram showed slow waves over areas of both hemispheres, characteristic findings of metabolic encephalopathy. A CT scan of the brain showed no structural abnormalities. Similar to the previous admission, after several days in hospital with supportive fluid therapy and absolute diet, the patient experienced a progressive improvement with complete clinical recovery. Three weeks later, the patient again noticed symptoms of dyspraxia and a tendency to sleep with progressive onset. She went to the emergency department where she was evaluated without finding any alterations in the examination or in the analytical or imaging tests, so she was sent home; there was no fever or any other symptoms suggestive of infection. Twenty-four hours later, she presented with a severely altered level of consciousness with a Glasgow score of 6. On this occasion, the patient had started a first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy 15 days earlier, with taxol 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5. All other electrolyte parameters, including calcaemia, were strictly normal. Venous blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.44. Brain CT and chest X-ray were normal. Given the presence of repeated episodes of confusional syndrome of probable metabolic cause, all within 3 months of the cystectomy, it was considered that this could be a metabolic complication of the shunt. After ruling out metabolic acidosis, it was decided to request blood ammonium levels, which showed an ammonaemia of 400 micrograms/dl (normal between 17-80). Given the diagnosis of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy of non-hepatic cause, fluid therapy, absolute diet, lactulose enemas were started and, given the clinical severity, haemodialysis was started. After 3 haemodialysis sessions, the patient experienced a neurological recovery parallel to the correction of ammonium levels, which decreased to normal. Subsequently, the ureterosigmoidostomy was surgically converted to an ileal conduit. Currently the patient continues with adjuvant chemotherapy treatment and has not had any new confusional episodes.   "
"A 60-year-old patient diagnosed with multiple high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (T1 G2-3) treated by bladder TUR on 12/01/05 and subsequent TUR for probable recurrence on 9/05/05 (AP: Chronic inflammatory tissue) for which complementary treatment was indicated with BCG instillations at a weekly dose, for six weeks he came to our centre with a constitutional picture of deterioration of the general condition with marked asthenia, fever of up to 39.5 ºC, predominantly in the evening, joint pain starting in the right foot, with subsequent involvement of the left foot, ankles, wrists, hands and fingers (symmetrical and cumulative involvement) together with conjunctivitis with marked ocular redness and purulent discharge. No aphthous ulcers or other oral or genital lesions reported. No other symptoms or signs of infectious locality. Laboratory tests showed marked leukocytosis (22,180 with 80% neutrophils), ESR 100 at the 2nd hour and CRP 49 mg/dl. In addition, there was an alteration of liver enzymes. Serology for hepatitis was negative, as well as for Yersinia and Chlamydia. Blood cultures, urine cultures and stool cultures were negative. Culture of Koch's bacillus in urine with negative Kinyoun's stain. HLA B27 and RF negative. Subsequently, arthrocentesis of the right ankle was performed with inflammatory fluid. Culture and crystals were negative. Given the negative results of the tests performed and the arthrocentesis, as a differential diagnosis, we considered polyarthritis secondary to BCG instillations. We started treatment with indomethacin and corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg) with a good clinical and analytical response. On discharge the patient continued treatment with indomethacin 75 mg (1-0-1) for 21 days. The patient came back for a check-up after three months and was asymptomatic.   "
"A 65-year-old woman with no personal history of interest was admitted with a high fever of 1 week's duration with no apparent source, for which reason a thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed, showing a large mass (9x8x7 cm) in the right upper pole of the kidney, in close contact with the liver. She reported no other symptoms except pain and functional impotence in the left lower limb for months of evolution, followed up by the Neurosurgery Department and diagnosed, after CT scan of the spine and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMR), with degenerative pathology, stenosis of the L4-L5 canal and spondyloarthrosis. She did not present constitutional syndrome or abdominal pain.  Physical examination revealed a soft and depressible abdomen, globular, without palpation of masses or megaliths. No pain on examination. Bilateral renal perfusion was negative. Laboratory tests showed no alterations in biochemistry with liver profile, total proteins and calcium in normal range. Haemoglobin count was 9.4 g/dL and 22,500 leukocytes (N: 72.9%). Haemostasis without findings. Sterile blood cultures and urine cultures <10,000UFC/ml. Broad-spectrum antibiotic and antipyretic treatment was started, despite which the patient presented daily febrile peaks with clinical repercussions in the form of asthenia. In view of the CT findings, an MRI scan was performed, confirming a solid mass in the right upper pole measuring 14x10x10 cm in diameter, with great signal heterogeneity and necrosis inside. The lesion extends upwards towards the liver with signs of hepatic infiltration. The right renal vein and vena cava are free. There are retrocaval adenopathies, pleural effusion and diaphragmatic thickening.  Given the liver involvement, the case was discussed with the General and Digestive Surgery Department, who agreed to perform a multislice CT scan to determine more accurately the level of involvement of this organ and to plan the surgical intervention. A heterogeneous mass with a necrotic appearance and a maximum diameter of 11 cm was observed in the upper half of the right kidney with no plane of separation of the postero-superior segments of the right hepatic lobe, with contiguous involvement of the same.  Following renal embolisation, surgery was performed by means of supra- and infra-umbilical median laparotomy. Examination showed renal tumour infiltrating the liver (segment VII) and diaphragm, with pathological lymphadenopathies in the renal hilum and free peritoneal fluid with no evidence of peritoneal implants. Samples of peritoneal fluid were taken for culture, cytology and gram negative results. Right radical nephrectomy was performed, including en bloc the VII hepatic segment, right adrenal and portion of the diaphragm. Cholecystectomy and lymphadenectomy. Pathological analysis revealed conventional type renal cell cancer of high cytological grade (Fuhrman grade 4), with foci of sarcomatoid transformation and extensive areas of tumour necrosis. Two satellite nodules on the peritoneal surface of the diaphragm and metastasis in a lymph node in the renal hilum. No involvement of the renal venous or excretory system or the adrenal gland. Stage pT4G3N1 according to UICC. After a satisfactory postoperative period with a progressive decrease in leukocytosis, oral chemotherapy treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors was started. The second control CT scan performed two months after the operation showed right pleural effusion with basal and posterior pleural nodular lesions. The cytology of the pleural fluid was compatible with adenocarcinoma.   "
"A 59-year-old man with a personal history of chronic alcoholism and smoking for years, who had suffered an episode of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage secondary to anti-inflammatory analgesics as complications. His urological history included a prostate syndrome of two years' evolution with no secondary complications. She came to the emergency department for intermittent febrile syndrome of four days' evolution, associated with urinary incontinence in the last 48 hours, together with dysuria and sacral pain radiating to both lower limbs and worsening with movement. Rectal tenesmus of recent onset was also associated. On arrival at the emergency department, fever of up to 39ºC was observed, the patient was haemodynamically stable, confused, drowsy and sweaty. On physical examination, the abdomen was globular, soft and depressible, not peritonitised. Painful on palpation in the bilateral lumbar area at L5-S1, as well as in the hypogastric area and perineal region. There is no impression of a bladder balloon. The genital examination was normal, and the rectal examination showed a slightly painful rectal volume I adenomatosis. The neurological examination shows decreased strength in both lower limbs in the upper third and sensitivity is preserved. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are present. Urgent blood and biochemistry tests showed: haemoglobin 14.2 g/dl, haematocrit 41.5%, leucocytes 20,300 (neutrophils 72.9%), glucose 212 mg/dl, creatinine 1.11 mg/dl, sodium 135 mEq/l, potassium 3.8 mEq/l, sedimentation rate 100 mm/h. Urinalysis with negative leucocytes, negative nitrites and normal sediment. The analysis was completed with a coagulation study which showed a prothrombin activity of 83%, a cephalin time of 27.2 sg, and fibrinogen of 574 mg/dl. An urgent abdomino-pelvic CT scan was requested at the outset, showing multiple simple cysts in the kidneys and left renal lithiasis. No dilatation of the urinary tract. The prostate was enlarged, with two hypodense lesions in both lateral lobes measuring 3.3 cm and 3 cm, compatible with prostatic abscess.  Empirical antibiotic treatment with Ceftriaxone 1 g/12 h, Ampicillin 1 g/6 h and Gentamicin 240 mg/24 h was then started. With the diagnosis of prostatic abscess, we decided to drain the collection under control with ECTR and urinary diversion. In the operating theatre, a lumbar puncture was performed prior to intradural anaesthesia. A cloudy-yellowish cerebrospinal fluid was observed and a sample was sent to microbiology and biochemistry, 1070 leukocytes were isolated (85% polymorphonuclear). On the other hand, the diagnosis of prostatic abscess was confirmed in the TCPR, which showed two collections of 30 and 28 mm affecting the left and right lobe respectively, the rest of the prostate being heterogeneous with no clear abscessed areas. By means of perineal puncture-drainage we evacuated 10 cc of pus from the collections described, leaving a cystostomy tube in place for drainage. We diverted the urine via suprapubic cystostomy.  From the culture of the samples (prostatic and lumbar puncture), sensitive S. aureus oxicilin was isolated, so we started treatment with Cloxacillin 2 g/24 and Rifampicin 300 mg/12h, and requested an urgent lumbar MRI which was reported as a subdural empyema, with no signs of spondylodiscitis.  Subsequent control based on new ECTR showed a clear improvement, although it was necessary to drain again a hyperechogenic area in the right prostatic lobe, evacuating 4 cc of purulent material. Subsequent check-ups did not reveal any new suspicious areas. A transesophageal echography was also performed, which ruled out secondary endocarditis, and a new lumbar MRI scan was performed after six weeks of antibiotic treatment, which showed complete resolution of the subdural empyema.   "
"A 72-year-old man with a personal history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ex-smoker and diagnosed with papillary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (T1G2). Transurethral resection of the tumour was performed and 3 weeks later treatment was started with a long course of endovesical instillations of BCG (Connaught strain, 109 colony-forming units per dose) administered weekly. After receiving 3 sessions, she went to the emergency department for general malaise and fever (38.5º) of ten days' evolution. There was no micturition syndrome or other symptoms. Physical examination was unremarkable with normal pulmonary auscultation, negative bilateral renal fist percussion and a non-painful or congestive prostate, size II/IV and adenomatous consistency. The haemogram showed slight leukocytosis without neutrophilia (leukocytes 12100 and 63.7% neutrophils). Urine and blood cultures were sterile and the search for acid fast bacilli in urine was unsuccessful. Chest X-ray showed bilateral and diffuse involvement of small millimetric nodules with thick calcified lymph nodes, compatible with miliary TB. Computed axial tomography (CT) showed gross calcified adenopathy in the right hilum and pulmonary ligament and bilateral and diffuse parenchymal involvement of small millimetric nodules affecting all lung fields. The patient was admitted and treated with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol. The patient's general condition improved and he was discharged and followed up on an outpatient basis. During follow-up, there were no adverse effects of the medication and no new febrile episodes or other symptoms. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was continued for 6 months and BCG instillations were discontinued. The control CT scan at two months showed a decrease in the size of the adenopathies as well as a decrease in the number of nodules, with complete disappearance in some lung segments.   "
"A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hiatal hernia under medical treatment came to the urology department for monosymptomatic and self-limiting haematuria. Physical examination revealed no findings of interest. Blood tests showed that all parameters were within normal limits. Intravenous urography showed a repletion defect in the right renal pelvis, which was later confirmed by abdominal computed tomography showing a mass in the pelvis amputating the middle calyx. Cytology was negative. Right nephroureterectomy was performed. Endoscopic ureteral deinsertion was first performed with the technical modification described below, followed by nephroureterectomy through a right subcostal incision. The macroscopic description of the specimen shows a vegetative, exophytic and papillary lesion that occupies the middle calyx and part of the renal pelvis without infiltrating parenchyma. Microscopically, the tumour was reported as a high-grade urothelial carcinoma that did not invade the lamina propria (Ta G3). After four years of follow-up the patient is alive and free of disease.   "
"77-year-old male patient (HC 53.296/3), ex-smoker of 60 cigarettes/day, with a history of: - Myocardial infarction. - Infrarenal abdominal aneurysm surgery. - Right renal lithiasis. - Arterial hypertension. He consulted for presenting monosymptomatic macroscopic haematuria in 1999. He was diagnosed with transitional carcinoma of the bladder showing very focal micropapillary areas (G3-pT1) and areas of carcinoma in situ.  Subsequently he presented tumour recurrence in 2000 and 2004 diagnosed as carcinoma in situ and was treated with intravesical chemotherapy (BCG). In January 2005 she came to our hospital with a tumour in the abdominal wall, at the level of the right iliac fossa, for which reason an abdominal CAT scan (computerised axial tomography) was performed which showed a solid mass measuring 7 x 6 cm in the musculature of the right anterior abdominal wall. Laparotomy was performed with en bloc resection of the abdominal wall. An irregular fragment weighing 180 g and measuring 9 x 9 x 7 cm was received at the pathology department. Serial sections identified a firm, whitish nodular lesion measuring 6 x 6 x 5 cm and not in contact with the resection edge, although it was focally close to it. The anatomopathological study showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma of high histological grade that frequently showed a micropapillary pattern and frequent permeation of lymphatic vessels, suggesting a metastatic origin. Immunohistochemistry was performed showing positivity for keratin (AE1-AE3) and cytokeratin (CK) 7 and negativity for CK20, TTF-1, N-Cam, Chromogranin and Synaptophysin. The final diagnosis was metastasis in the abdominal wall due to micropapillary bladder carcinoma.  Subsequently, PET (positron emission tomography) was performed, and a hypermetabolic focal deposit was observed in the right hemipelvis, in the path of the iliac, compatible with lymph node metastasis, a finding that was confirmed in a subsequent abdominopelvic CAT scan. However, no recurrence was detected in the bladder and urine cytology was negative. Four cycles of chemotherapy were administered according to the Carboplatin-Gemcitabine protocol and a complete response was observed on review. The patient is alive and disease-free 12 months after the initial diagnosis.   "
"A 29 year old patient was referred to our clinic following pain in the right teste 3 months earlier, which subsided with anti-inflammatory treatment. One month later he had a new episode of pain in the right testicle which was diagnosed as orchiepididymitis but which did not resolve with medical treatment. His only personal history was an allergy to sulphonamides. No urological history of interest. Physical examination revealed a painless tumour in the posteroinferior pole of the right teste. Suspicion of a testicular tumour led to a complete blood analysis with tumour markers and a testicular ultrasound scan, the results of which showed AFP 36.4 ng/ml and Beta-hCG 4.2 mIU/ml. The ultrasound showed a 23 mm tumour in the lower pole of the right testicle with non-cystic characteristics suspicious of neoplasia. The patient underwent a radical right inguinal orchiectomy and the pathological anatomy revealed a 2 cm mixed germ cell tumour formed by embryonal carcinoma and foci of teratoma. No vascular or lymphatic invasion. Albuginea, spermatic cord and epididymis free of tumour. As it was a Stage I Non Seminomatous Germinal Tumour, it was decided by mutual agreement with the patient not to receive adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and to follow a strict observational control. The patient underwent periodic check-ups according to our hospital protocol and remained free of disease in the imaging techniques, clinically and analytically for 7 and a half years until a control ultrasound study detected microcalcifications in the left testicle with a single hypoechoic nodule measuring 7 mm x 9 mm, also with calcifications and no increase in Doppler flow, which was compatible with a testicular tumour. A left varicocele was also observed. Physical examination was unremarkable and tumour markers were normal. After left inguinal orchiectomy, the pathological anatomy reports a 0.5 cm seminoma infiltrating the capsule of the atrophic testicle with extensive intratubular germ cell neoplasia. No vascular or lymphatic infiltration. Treatment was completed with chemotherapy and hormone replacement therapy. Currently she has been disease free for 4 years.   "
"A 25 year old patient was referred to our clinic after an ultrasound study revealed a hypoechoic mass suggestive of neoplasia in the left teste. The patient consulted the speciality centre because he had noticed a painless enlargement of the left testicle for some days. His personal history included having suffered from a right testicular lift in childhood. At the age of 9 months, he suffered a case of meningitis that left him with a permanent neurological deficit and residual seizures. In addition, appendectomy and tenotomy of the Achilles in infancy. At our clinic, she was asked for a new ultrasound scan, tumour markers and an extension study using computerised axial tomography. The results of the tests showed a beta-HCG of 5.7 mIU/ml, with normal lactate dehydrogenase and alpha-fetoprotein. Ultrasound showed an 8 cm mass in the left teste with multiple hypoechoic nodules compatible with a testicular tumour, as well as microcalcifications in the right testicle. No adenopathies or metastases were seen in the thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan. He underwent radical left orchiectomy via the inguinal route and the pathological anatomy analysis reported classic seminoma that did not infiltrate the albuginea or the cord, nor was there any vascular or lymphatic invasion. With the diagnosis of classic Stage I Seminoma, conservative treatment was chosen. At 10 months, a control ultrasound study revealed a hypoechoic nodule in the right testicle suspicious of neoplasia. Physical examination and tumour markers were normal. A radical right orchiectomy was performed and the pathological anatomy study reported a classic type of seminoma with foci of Intratubular Germ Cell Neoplasia measuring approximately 4.5 cm. Vascular tracts, albuginea and spermatic cord free of tumour. Hormone replacement therapy was also started. Three months later, an increase in beta-HCG of up to 4.5 mIU/ml was detected, with the rest of the tumour markers normal, and a new thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan was requested, which revealed a retroperitoneal mass measuring 3 cm x 8 cm para-aortic below the left renal artery, extending to the iliac bifurcation. Another 2 cm x 2 cm nodular image with a necrotic centre and peripheral contrast uptake is also seen more anteriorly. With the diagnosis of abdominal adenopathic relapse of classic seminoma, treatment began with 4 cycles of Etoposide and Cisplatin. He has now been disease-free for approximately 7 years.   "
"Patient aged 15 years with no previous history of interest. He was seen in the emergency department for vomiting and epigastric pain of three days' evolution, and reported a weight loss of 7 kg in the previous two months. Physical examination revealed moderate mucocutaneous pallor, hepatosplenomegaly of two finger widths and epigastric pain on deep palpation. Scrotal examination revealed an enlarged left teste (three to four times larger than normal) with a hard consistency, irregular surface and non-painful. On cross-examination, the patient confirmed that he had noticed a progressive and painless enlargement of the teste for about a year. The ED blood test showed only a haematocrit of 35%, haemoglobin 11.3 g/dl and LDH 2802 U/L. The abdominal and testicular ultrasound showed the existence of a very enlarged left teste with heterogeneous echogenicity, with foci of necrosis and liquid areas; and at the hepatic level there were extensive images suggestive of metastasis.  Chest X-ray revealed multiple pulmonary metastases and discrete pleural effusion, which after thoracentesis revealed haematic pleural fluid. Twelve hours after admission, a thoracoabdominal CT scan showed extensive metastatic involvement, with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, right pleural effusion, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly with massive metastatic involvement, and possibly splenic and pancreatic metastases. There was no intraperitoneal free fluid.  Blood samples were obtained for testicular markers: alpha-fetoprotein 15000 ng/ml and betaHCG of 200,000 mIU/ml, and orchiectomy was scheduled for the following day. Thirty-six hours after admission, rapidly onset hypovolaemic shock with pain and abdominal bulging occurred, requiring urgent laparotomy after abdominal ultrasound, which showed a large amount of intraperitoneal fluid. During laparotomy, extensive metastatic involvement was found in the tail of the pancreas, spleen and liver with rupture of splenic and hepatic metastases and massive haemoperitoneum due to active bleeding and diffuse hepatic haematoma. Splenectomy was performed with suture and surgicel tamponade of the bleeding liver areas; at the same time, radical left orchiectomy was performed. The macroscopic anatomopathology describes: ""piece of radical orchiectomy, weighing 233 grams and measuring 8x9x5 cm, accompanied by 7 cm of cord; on serial sections the testicular parenchyma shows an almost total replacement by a whitish tumour, with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage that does not appear to go beyond the testicular coverings"". Microscopic histopathology of the testicle showed a mixed germinal malignant neoplasm with areas of embryonal carcinoma, endodermal sinus tumour, choriocarcinoma and teratoma.  The spleen measured 15x7x3 cm and weighed 180 g. Serial sections showed six nodular, rounded, whitish formations with central necrosis. Microscopy confirmed that the splenic lesions were metastases of the testicular neoplasm.  Forty-eight hours after the operation, the patient suffered a new episode of hypovolemic shock with evident signs of intra-abdominal bleeding, so a new laparotomy was performed, verifying the existence of a hepatic burst at the level of the right and left lobe, with incoercible haemorrhage and death shortly afterwards.   "
"62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridaemia. Urological history of high-grade infiltrating bladder tumour (G3T2 p53+ transitional cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ in sample 1 of the standardised multiple biopsy). After radical cystectomy with Studer type bladder reconstruction (G3 urothelial carcinoma of solid pattern, pt3b, negative nodes) she presented with sepsis of urinary origin and was admitted to the semi-critical unit with intensive antibiotic and diuretic treatment. Three days after admission, the patient reported sudden onset tinnitus accompanied by bilateral hypoacusis of a significant degree. The patient had no vertiginous or unstable symptoms. There was no otalgia, otodynia or sensation of otic fullness. Facial mobility was preserved. The physical examination was strictly normal, with audiometry revealing profound hypoacusis of the right ear and cophosis of the left ear, with normal impedance testing.  Once the sensorineural nature of the hearing loss had been confirmed, a review of the patient's clinical history and a new anamnesis were carried out in order to carry out an aetiological study. Once the relationship with systemic diseases, intracranial infections and trauma was ruled out, the hypoacusis was attributed to the administration of intravenous furosemide in the initial management of septic shock. Furosemide administration was discontinued, and the association of other ototoxic drugs was proscribed. Treatment with high-dose parenteral corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 120 mg/24) and oral pentoxifylline (400 mg/ 8 h) was given according to the protocol for sudden hearing loss. (400 mg/ 8 h). After 7 days of parenteral treatment, oral corticosteroid treatment was continued in a descending pattern for a further 14 days (Prednisone 60 mg/day for 7 days and 30 mg/day for 7 days), maintaining pentoxifylline at the same dose for several months. Audiometry two weeks after treatment showed an improvement in tonal hearing with the appearance of auditory traces in the low frequencies in the left ear and an increase in the thresholds in the right ear.  Six months after treatment, the patient's hearing in the right ear has recovered to 58%. The left ear has residual hearing in the low frequencies, but no clear recovery has been observed. The patient continues to be monitored at our centre, and the fitting of an acoustic prosthesis in the right ear has been recommended. Oncologically, she has started complementary treatment with chemotherapy, without affecting her hearing levels.   "
"A 60-year-old man with a history of repeated urinary tract infections attended the emergency department for presenting a mass in the lower abdomen, of about six months' duration, which bled spontaneously and caused intense pain. Physical examination revealed a bladder exstrophy plaque in the hypogastrium and a complete epispadic penis, which had not been surgically corrected during childhood. There was an exophytic formation in the sinus of the plaque, 10 cm in diameter and hard in consistency, with a friable surface that bled at the slightest friction. No inguinal lymph nodes were palpable and the rest of the examination revealed no other findings.  Blood tests showed a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, with all other parameters being normal. After admission to hospital to complete the study, bilateral renal ultrasound was performed, showing grade III/IV dilatation of both pyelocaliceal systems. Intravenous urography showed functional annulment of the right kidney, with delayed elimination of the left kidney. The suspicious mass was biopsied and the histopathological result was bladder adenocarcinoma. The thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan and bone scan showed no evidence of metastasis. The patient underwent surgery, with radical cystoprostatectomy with lymphadenectomy plus Indiana shunt and closure of the abdominal wall defect with fascia lata. Histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed the existence of an intestinal adenocarcinoma with some signet ring cells. The margins of the specimen were infiltrated, with extensive involvement of adjacent soft tissue and peritoneum, and two iliac adenopathies infiltrated by the tumour were isolated. The tumour stage corresponded to T4bN2M0. The medical oncology department rejected adjuvant treatment, considering that it would not increase the patient's survival. At the check-up 6 months after surgery, a painless left inguinal lymphadenopathy of increased consistency was palpated, together with induration of the edges of the surgical wound, a finding compatible with local recurrence of the tumour that was confirmed by biopsy of the suspicious area. Bone scanning at this time remained negative and CT scan showed a heterogeneous mass with poorly defined borders in the surgical site. The patient died 2 months later from sepsis of urinary origin.   "
"Male patient, 68 years old, former textile industry worker, referred for consultation due to complex renal cystic mass. History of rheumatoid arthritis, controlled hypertension, dyslipidaemia, pulmonary tuberculosis 40 years ago, medicated with indapamide, sinvastatin and NSAIDs. He denied smoking habits or exposure to chemical agents. He reported exposure to sheep in his youth. He denied a known history of renal lithiasis. He had undergone left hip arthroplasty years ago. No history of abdominal or genitourinary surgery. For months he reported elimination of gelatinous material in the urine, with no specific shape, accompanied by episodes of total macroscopic haematuria, without clots. No other accompanying symptoms, such as back pain, nausea or vomiting, or lower urinary complaints. No anorexia, asthenia or weight loss. No respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination there was a non-painful left flank/lumbar emplasia. No hepatomegaly, no abnormal abdominal collateral circulation. Genitalia without clinical varicocele. Lower limbs without oedema. No peripheral adenopathies. Pulmonary auscultation without apparent alterations. In analytical terms he had mild anaemia (Hb 12.7 g/dL), without leukocytosis. Relative eosinophilia (2800/µL). SV 67 mm. Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL. Urea 77 mg/dL. Ultrasonography revealed a right kidney of somewhat reduced dimensions (10.8 cm) and with increased echogenicity of the parenchyma, presenting a simple cyst in the upper pole. The left kidney showed a large complex cyst of the upper pole (70 x 68 x 67 mm), with evident solid content and associated regions with posterior acoustic shadowing. Subjected to abdominopelvic CT - voluminous complex cystic formation containing gross parietal and central calcifications, occupying the upper two thirds of the left kidney, as well as fine septa within it, presenting attenuation values varying between 10 and 20 Housefield units. Subsequent to contrast administration, there was evidence of contrast uptake by the walls. No lesions of solid abdominal organs, presence of retroperitoneal adenopathies or morphological alteration of the suprarenal glands were evident. Chest X-ray without significant alterations, such as cystic lesions or alterations compatible with lesions of metastatic nature or active tuberculosis. Negative Mantoux (tuberculin test). Acid-fast bacilli negative. Urine cultures (multiple samples) in Lowenstein's medium negative. Serology for Echinococcos granulosis and multilocularis negative.  With the diagnosis of Bosniak class IV complex cystic mass and in the absence of support for lesions of specific/parasitic infectious nature, he underwent left radical nephrectomy by lumbotomy incision over the 12th rib bed. Pathological examination showed a neoplasm of 11.5 cm in greatest dimension, consisting of glands of simple and complex structure, the epithelium being moderately differentiated and centred by mucoid material in the form of large mucin pools with tumour fragments. The lesion invaded the renal parenchyma without affecting the capsule. The remaining parenchyma showed signs of pyelonephritis with mild atrophy. Surgical margins were free of tumour. Conclusion: mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis PT3NxMx.  After histological results were available, the patient underwent upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, which showed no alterations. He was followed up for 10 months. The patient is totally asymptomatic and there is no evidence of recurrence of the disease, locally or at a distance.   "
"Male, 40 years old Personal history: Leoch on 4 previous occasions. 5th Leoch of left renal lithiasis, lower ureteric pyelocaliceal lithiasis, 2.5 cm. Carrier of double J catheter due to hydronephrosis. 5,000 impacts were applied, at intensity 3-4. No previous hypertension, neither while the haematoma remained, nor after its evacuation. Admitted from the emergency department 9 days after the Leoch due to lumbar pain, HtO of 27 and Hb of 9. Ultrasound and CT scan showed a subcapsular haematoma measuring 15x9 cm.  Three red blood cell concentrates were transfused. Evacuation of the haematoma via the lumbar route 12 days after admission, due to pain and persistence of the size of the haematoma in the control CT scan. On the 4th postoperative day she was discharged with good clinical evolution. Subsequently, she was treated with urinary alkalinisers until the lithiasic remnants that persisted after lithotripsy disappeared; several subsequent controls with normal echo and IVUS.  "
"Male patient aged 34 years. Personal history: Hepatitis in childhood. Right ureterolitectomy 10 years earlier. Cystinuria. IVU prior to Leoch with normal bilateral renal function but with a smaller right kidney than the left. No AHT. Leoch of lithiasis of 1 cm in the lower calyx of the right kidney.3,500 impacts, intensity 3. 5-6 hours after treatment she presented intense pain in the right flank, diagnosed by ultrasound as a discrete subcapsular haematoma. A CT scan three days later showed a 12 cm haematoma. Two red blood cell concentrates were transfused.  14 days after lithotripsy, the haematoma was drained by open surgery. Discharge from hospital 7 days later. Subsequent ultrasound and IVUS examinations are similar to pre-Leoch.  "
"Male, 53 years old. Calcium lithiasis. Location of the lithiasis and size: multiple calcific stones between 1-1.5 cm; left kidney. Personal history: undergoing nephrology check-ups for AHT and mild CRF. Right pyohydronephrosis secondary to distal ureteral lithiasis that required percutaneous nephrostomy, partially recovering the function of the right kidney. Nine lithotripsies, five on the right side (two ureteral and three renal) and three on the left kidney, although the haematoma occurred after the first one on this kidney. Number of waves and intensity: 3,500 impacts, intensity 3-4. Immediate post-Leoch symptoms: intense pain a few hours after the procedure. CT scan: left subcapsular haematoma of 15 cm.  Subsequent treatment: analgesia and analytical controls. Ht decreased to 32 and Hb 10. No haemodynamic alterations. No transfusions were required. Admitted to hospital for 8 days. Evolution of the haematoma: No intense pain except for the first 4-5 days, so together with haemodynamic stability and maintenance of Hb, conservative treatment was decided, and the haematoma was almost completely reabsorbed in 18 months; ultrasound and CT scan at one and a half years showed small remains of the haematoma.

"58-year-old woman. Calcific calcific lithiasis of the left kidney. Personal history: severe hypertension difficult to control, as on a previous occasion Leoch had to be suspended until the blood pressure figures were stabilised with study and treatment by the Nephrology Department. Moderate obesity. First Leoch. Number and intensity of waves: 4,500 to 4. Clinical: Admitted two days after Leoch of the left kidney with left lumboabdominal pain and hypovolemic shock with Hb of 7 and Hto 24. Four units of red blood cell concentrate were transfused over the days of admission to stabilise the Hb between 9 and 9.5. CT scan showed the existence of a subcapsular haematoma with lithiasic fragments and pleural effusion on the left.  In IVUS a few days later, there was functional delay of the left kidney and poor visualisation of the calyces and infundibula due to compression of the same with normal ureter.  Thoracentesis was performed with evacuation of 200 cc of haematic fluid. Twelve days after the haematoma, it was drained by lumbotomy; four days later she was discharged in good general condition. Subsequent radiological and analytical controls confirmed normal bilateral renal function.  "
"A 57-year-old patient referred to the emergency department of our hospital by his general practitioner for presenting with pain in the glans penis for a week, with progressive appearance of a reddened lesion affecting the distal portion, covered with fibrin, necrotic appearance, with a large exudative component, which seems to be a thrombotic process. His personal history included venous insufficiency with trophic alterations in the lower limbs. A smoker of 40 cigarettes a day for many years, he was diagnosed three months ago in the urology department with benign prostatic hyperplasia requiring medical treatment. During the diagnostic work-up of BPH, the patient underwent a TR, determination of PSA, ultrasound scans, etc., but these studies did not reveal any abnormalities worth mentioning. The current examination showed that the anterior two thirds of the glans were swollen, hardened, with a necrotic appearance and abundant exudate and fibrin covering the area.  In view of the normal urological studies and the total lack of information about the morbid process, a minimal biopsy of the lesion was taken. We were informed of necrosis phenomena, dense acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate and thrombosis of the dermis. In this situation of ignorance of the morbid process, but in the face of a necrotic process that did not improve with the symptomatic treatments established, partial amputation of the penis was indicated. The glans penis was removed along with a small portion of the corpora cavernosa. The pathological anatomy service informed us of the presence of a tumour thrombosis of the corpora cavernosa compatible with metastasis from an epidermoid carcinoma.  In view of this unusual situation, we proceeded to locate the primitive tumour and study its extension. The abdominal CT scan revealed small subcentimetric para-aortic, interaorto-caval and mesenteric root adenopathies in the retroperitoneum. The rest was within normal limits. Complementary studies were continued in search of the primitive neoplasm, at the same time as an assessment was requested by the Traumatology Department of a sudden onset and severe intensity of pain in the shoulder. The referred pain is explained by the existence of a pathological fracture at the level of the upper third of the right humerus due to a radiological lesion typical of bone metastasis. The bone scan corroborates the diagnosis of bone metastasis at the level of the proximal third of the humerus, with no other distant pathological deposits. Further studies are carried out and the evaluation by the Otorhinolaryngology Department is absolutely normal. The Digestive Service came into play and performed an endoscopic study and discovered a mameloned and ulcerated mass of 3 centimetres in diameter at the level of the cardia, which corresponded to gastric infiltration by a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.  Polychemotherapy treatment was started but the patient's condition progressively worsened and he died a few months later.   "
"65-year-old patient diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate Gleason 6/10 in both prostatic lobes (TNM Stage 2003 T1c). PSA at the time of diagnosis was 9.43 ng/ml. In January 2006 the patient underwent a radical retorpubic prostatectomy (Anatomical pathology report: Gleason 6/10 pT2c prostate adenocarcinoma with tumour-free margins). During dissection of the posterior aspect of the prostate 2 cm opening in the anterior aspect of the rectum. Direct closure of the rectal wall with loose stitches. No other intraoperative complications. On the fifth postoperative day, the patient presented fever (37.6ºC), abdominal pain, urinary fistula, faecaluria and signs of peritonitis on physical examination. An abdominal CT scan was performed showing free retrohepatic fluid and an urgent laparotomy was performed, showing faecaloid peritonitis secondary to perforation of the sigma and abundant urine and faeces in the pelvis. A new vesico-urethral suture, resection of the perforated segment of the sigma and discharge colostomy were performed. After emergency surgery, the patient developed septic symptoms and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory support. During the septic condition, the patient presented urinary fistula with abundant urine leakage through the drainage and infection of the surgical wound. After respiratory and haemodynamic stabilisation, the patient was discharged from the ICU with a permeable colostomy. Clear urine. Subsequently, disappearance of urinary fistula and fat necrosis in the distal third of the surgical wound, observing abdominal musculature as a background of the ulcer. In March 2006, cystography was performed, showing passage of contrast from the urethrovesical junction to the rectal ampulla. With a diagnosis of vesico-rectal fistula, conservative treatment was indicated with bladder catheterisation until resolution of the surgical wound infection and closure by secondary intention.  In October 2006, given the persistence of the fistulous orifice, closure of the urethro-rectal fistula and transanal mucosal advancement plasty was performed. One month after surgery, cystography was performed and no contrast leakage was observed outside the urinary tract, so the bladder catheter was removed.  In March 2007 colostomy closure and eventroplasty of the abdominal wall with mesh was performed. In June 2007 the patient had comfortable spontaneous urination and normal bowel movements. Absence of urinary incontinence. Erectile dysfunction treated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors and PSA less than 0.15 ng/ml.   "
"65-year-old man, with a history of transurethral resection (TUR) for high-grade superficial transitional cell bladder neoplasia (pT1 G3), with subsequent low-grade recurrence, with the following history of interest: smoker of more than 1 pack/day, AHT, severe COPD and dilated cardiomyopathy. During follow-up for his bladder neoplasia, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed without intravenous (IV) contrast, in which a heterogeneous nodular lesion with fatty content (hypodense), 2 cm in diameter, well-defined borders and retroperitoneal location, posterior to the inferior vena cava, was observed as a casual finding. The study was completed with an abdominal ultrasound scan showing a retroperitoneal hyperechoic lesion in contact with the right lateral aspect of the inferior vena cava.  A wait-and-see approach was adopted and a follow-up CT scan was performed one year later, showing an enlargement of the mass (4 cm maximum diameter) which displaced and compressed the inferior vena cava medially without showing signs of invasion. In view of the suspicion of retroperitoneal liposarcoma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV gadolinium was performed, confirming the fat content of the lesion and a discrete heterogeneous contrast uptake. The T1 sequences showed a hyperintense lesion, although slightly inferior to the retroperitoneal, mesenteric and subcutaneous fat, with an area of lower intensity in the upper pole of the lesion. The fat suppression technique showed a discrete hyperintensity compared to perilesional fat mainly in the upper half.  In the opposite phase images the lesion was hypointense with a nodular area at its upper pole of higher signal intensity corresponding to the area of lower intensity in the T1 sequence and higher intensity in the fat suppression. After gadolinium administration, a discrete gadolinium uptake was observed. With the radiological diagnosis of a fatty tumour, probably liposarcoma (given its predominant frequency among retroperitoneal masses), surgery was decided. A reniform mass was surgically removed, posterior to the inferior vena cava and anchored in the retroperitoneum to the anterior vertebral ligament, 2 cm from the right renal vein at its lower edge. The lesion had no vascular pedicle, showing only small peripheral lymphatics. A pseudoencapsulated lobular tumour measuring 6 x 5 cm, with an adipose consistency and a greyish-yellowish colour was referred for pathological examination. Histology of the specimen revealed a well-demarcated adipose tumour, showing extensive haematopoietic islets with the presence of the 3 series together with rounded lymphoid aggregates, diagnostic of lumbar prevertebral myelolipoma, although a bone marrow study was recommended in order to rule out its primary pathology (extramedullary haematopoiesis in the context of a myelodysplastic-myeloproliferative syndrome). The latter possibility was ruled out by analysis of the bone marrow, confirming the diagnosis of retroperitoneal extra-adrenal myelolipoma.   "
"A 60-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy for a 9.7x7.5 cm lower pole renal tumour. During the operation, peritumoral para-aortic and mesocolon adhesions were found, where some large lymphatic vessels were ligated or coagulated, careful dissection of the hilum was performed and the distal ureter was clipped, with no intraoperative incidences and bleeding of less than 100 ml. The anatomopathological study showed solid, cystic clear cell renal carcinoma with areas of intratumoural bleeding, Fuhrman grade 2-3, stage pT2 pN0. The postoperative period was uneventful, a decrease in haemoglobin of 1.5 g/dl (from 13.2 to 11.7) was detected, and the patient was discharged from hospital five days later. One month after discharge, he consulted for an increase in abdominal perimeter causing dyspnoea and discomfort, and imaging studies showed diffusely distributed ascites, suggestive of chylous ascites. Analyses showed Hb 11.1 g/dl, leukocyte formula and lymphocyte count normal, normal renal and hepatic function and mild hypo-proteinemia - albumin 2.9 g/dl (N: 3.4-5), total protein 5.8 g/dl (N: 6.4-8.2). She was treated conservatively, without diagnostic or evacuating paracentesis, with a low-salt and low-lipid diet, protein supplements and spironolactone 50 mg/day, with symptomatic and abdominal perimeter improvement, hospital discharge after six days, and complete healing confirmed by abdominal ultrasound one month later. Six months later she has no symptoms or signs of recurrence, and the abdominal ultrasound is normal.   "
"A 39-year-old woman with a personal history of pulmonary tuberculosis, repeated renal colic and stress urinary incontinence. She attended the emergency department for low back pain and pollakiuria. Abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral ureterohydronephrosis with preserved left renal parenchyma and right kidney with thin, unstructured cortical tissue, as well as renal function with serum creatinine of 1.98 mg/dl. Therefore, a urinary diversion by percutaneous nephrostomy of the left kidney was decided.  A diagnosis of genitourinary tuberculosis was made due to a positive Lowestein culture in the urine evacuated by the nephrostomy and medical treatment was started with Rifampicin, Isoniazid and Pyrazinamide for 2 months and Isoniazid and Rifampicin for a further 4 months. During the outpatient follow-up, a renal scan was performed showing a non-functioning right kidney and the left kidney with preserved morphology and discrete ectasia of the upper calyceal system. An abdominal ultrasound was also obtained which corroborated the findings of the renal scan. The patient discontinued antibiotic treatment and follow-up consultations after 6 months, due to social problems, despite persistent disease in the cultures. One year after diagnosis, medical treatment was restarted and continued for one year with adequate clinical follow-up. Intravenous urography was performed, with a diagnosis of right mastic kidney and stenosis of the last few cms of the left ureter. A right nephrectomy was performed and left uretero-vesical reimplantation was attempted, during which the left ureter was disinserted 1 cm below the pyeloureteral junction, so a permanent left urinary diversion (racket nephrostomy) was decided.  For three years he maintained good renal function and periodic changes of racquet nephrostomy with the evident limitation and affectation of his quality of life. After this time and given the patient's good physical condition and age, reconstruction of the excretory tract with ileum was considered. The preoperative evaluation confirmed complete bladder retraction, so simultaneous replacement of this organ was considered.  The surgical technique consisted of freeing and defunctionalising 60 cm of ileum with opening of the left mesocolon to allow anastomosis of the proximal end of the ileum to the pelvis of the left kidney, with loose sutures and a double J tutor catheter. Subsequently, cystectomy and hysterectomy of the myomatous uterus was performed because the anastomosis between the neobladder and urethra was difficult, with detubulation of 30 cm of distal ileum in isoperistaltic position, forming a ""U"" shaped neobladder with modified Camey type folding of the final 20 cm.  The postoperative period was uneventful with good clinical evolution and removal of the ureteral tutor 21 days after surgery. Cystogram showing that the bladder suture was watertight, although the presence of vesico-ureteral reflux was observed, with high pressure. After removal of the nephrostomy and bladder catheter, the patient was discharged from hospital with hourly urination and leaks between micturitions, requiring compresses and the Credé manoeuvre to empty the bladder.  Six months later, cystography showed a larger bladder capacity and little reflux, but night-time incontinence persisted.  During the periodic check-ups performed every 6 months, the patient expressed her satisfaction with the results obtained after surgery and her improved quality of life, as she no longer has urinary diversion and urine leaks are scarce and nocturnal. At present, 4 years after the last surgery, she has urination every 2-3 hours with daytime continence and a night-time pad, bladder emptying at the expense of the Credé and Valsalva manoeuvre without subsequent residue, requiring 1 g daily of oral bicarbonate for adequate metabolic control and a plasma Creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl7.   "
"An 80-year-old man with a history of TURP 3 years earlier consulted for pollakiuria, hypogastric pain and fever of 48 hours' evolution one month after undergoing surgery for incarcerated right inguinal hernia. On questioning, he reported a progressive worsening of his urinary stream in recent months. Physical examination revealed bladder ballooning, minimal serous discharge from the inguinal wound and painful induration of the penile base. A cystostomy catheter was placed due to the impossibility of urethral catheterisation, and with blood tests showing leukocytosis with a left shift and urine sediment positive for gram-negative bacilli, he was admitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment and study. After presenting clinical and analytical improvement, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a subcicatricial seroma at the right inguinal level and cystography by cystostomy catheter where an extravasation was observed in the proximal penile urethra.  Once the febrile UTI was treated with a positive urine culture for multisensitive E.coli, the patient was discharged. At the follow-up visit, the patient reported significant perineal pain that he had been treating with anti-inflammatory drugs and provided the anatomo-pathological report from the surgery department where he had undergone surgery for inguinal hernia, stating that the resected material was a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma lymphadenopathy. At that time, the patient was diagnosed as a possible squamous cell carcinoma of the urethra with inguinal adenopathy and an extension study was performed. Pelvic MRI showed a 3 cm collection between the urethra and corpora cavernosa as well as right inguinal lymphadenopathy.  Thoracic-abdominal CT scan showed a single subpleural lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung suggestive of metastasis, with no adenopathy. The patient was admitted for poor control of perineal pain and the appearance of several nodular skin lesions on the pubis and right thigh.  Biopsy of one of these lesions was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent 6 cycles of palliative polychemotherapy with cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (CDDP 137 mg-5FU 6839 mg) with good tolerance and good initial clinical response with improvement of asthenia, partial regression of the lethargy and disappearance of the pulmonary lesion. One month after the end of chemotherapy, he presented early progression of the disease with the appearance of a greater number of skin lesions. She then underwent palliative radiotherapy, achieving better control of perineal pain and little response of the lethal lesions. She is currently being treated with morphine and monitored by a palliative care team at home, 9 months after the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.   "
"Male patient, aged 64 years, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years, poorly treated, systemic arterial hypertension diagnosed 6 months previously without treatment, heart failure diagnosed 6 months previously and diagnosis of chronic renal failure, also made 6 months previously, treated with peritoneal dialysis. He presented with symptoms of 2 weeks' evolution, following hospitalisation for metabolic decompensation, where a transurethral catheter was placed for 2 weeks; he reported abdominal pain in the hypogastrium, of moderate intensity and oppressive type, radiating to the glans penis, and the use of self-prescribed topical treatments without improvement. The pain intensified to the point of being incapacitating 3 days prior to admission, so he came to our department. She denied fever or other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination revealed an unaltered abdomen, a penis with necrosis on the glans penis and purulent discharge through the urethral meatus, as well as areas of necrosis on the first and second ortex of both feet. Laboratory tests showed: haemoglobin 9.9 g/dl, leucocytes 11,100, platelets 304,000, glucose 138 mg/dl, BUN 143.8 mg/dl, creatinine 7.71 mg/dl, calcium 7.79 mmol/l, phosphorus 7.08 mmol/l, potassium 5.75 mmol/l, pH 7.17, pCO2 47 mmHg and HCO3 17.1 mmol/l. He underwent phalectomy, firstly partial, but in the trans-operative period it was decided to perform a total phalectomy due to lack of vascularity up to the base of the penis; in addition, a perineal meatus was performed. The pathology report was: distal ischaemic necrosis of the glans and foreskin associated with microthrombosis and bacterial proliferation, resection edges with dystrophic calcification of the arterial media. The result of secretion culture was Escherichia coli, for which he received antibiotic therapy for 7 days. He was kept in hospital for 9 days and was discharged in good general condition; he is currently under surveillance.  "
"A 48-year-old male patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension and hypothyroidism, diagnosed 8 years previously, with inadequate control, as well as chronic renal insufficiency of 2 years' evolution, treated with haemodialysis. She presented with two weeks of symptoms characterised by pain in the glans penis and irritative urinary symptoms; one week later she reported hypochromia in the glans penis, as well as a sensation of local anaesthesia, and a violaceous lesion was added on the dorsal side of the glans penis, which extended and was accompanied by a purulent secretion, for which she came to our department. Physical examination revealed the presence of a hypochromic, hypothermic glans penis with an area of necrosis on the dorsum, accompanied by a slight purulent and fetid discharge. Blood biometry reported: haemoglobin 8.02 g/dl, leucocytes 8,060, platelets 355. 000; blood chemistry: glucose 277 mg/dl, creatinine 5.5 mg/dl, BUN 90.1 mg/dl; liver function tests: TGO 48, TGP 32, alkaline phosphatase 332, DHL 232; serum electrolytes: sodium 128.8 mmol/l, potassium 6.28 mmol/l, chlorine 96.4 mmol/l, calcium 7.92 mmol/l, phosphorus 7.36 mmol/l. He underwent partial phalectomy, without complications. Pathological analysis reported: necrosis and acute and chronic inflammatory process, abscessed and ulcerated, with arteriosclerosis obliterans. The patient is currently under surveillance.  "
"Male patient, aged 54 years, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus since the age of 30, chronic renal failure for 2 years, treated with haemodialysis. He had undergone supracondylar amputation of the right pelvic limb 4 years earlier. He came to our department for symptoms of 1 month's evolution, characterised by the presence of blistering lesions on the glans penis, asymptomatic, which progressed to ulcers a week later; subsequently, he reported intense pain in the glans penis and hypochromia, which was the reason for which he consulted us. Physical examination revealed a hypochromic, hypothermic, hypochromic glans penis with a necrotic lesion of approximately 1.5 cm on the ventral side, as well as transurethral purulent discharge and induration of the distal third of the penile shaft. Blood biometry reported: haemoglobin 10.1 g/dl, leucocytes 4,890, platelets 283,000; blood chemistry: glucose 55 mg/dl, creatinine 7.88 mg/dl, BUN 65.5 mg/dl; serum electrolytes: sodium 145.3 mmol/l, potassium 4.81 mmol/l, chlorine 99 mmol/l, calcium 8.3, mmol/l and phosphorus 9.21 mmol/l. Liver function tests reported: TGO 18, TGP 14 and alkaline phosphatase 64. A penile Doppler ultrasound was performed with Caverject, showing a total absence of flow in 100% of the penis. Surgical management was proposed to the patient and he decided to go to another institution.   "
"A 68-year-old patient with a history of severe mental retardation and deaf-mutism secondary to meningitis in childhood. She consulted our emergency department due to pain and inflammation in the left hemiscrotal for more than 3 weeks, which did not subside despite antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment. Examination revealed a generalised increase in scrotal contents, more marked on the left side, with a painful testicle on palpation, firm consistency, smooth surface and thickened epididymis. The right testicle was normal. Urine sediment revealed the presence of pyuria. Ultrasonography revealed an enlarged, heterogeneous left testicle, with a medial area with multiple cystic cavities, some of which were hypoechogenic. Diagnosed as advanced orchitis, the patient was discharged with analgesic-anti-inflammatory treatment. Eight days later, the patient attended the urology department for a check-up, where palpation clearly delimited a nodule, which suggested a differential diagnosis of testicular neoplasia. A radical left orchiectomy was performed, after determination of tumour markers (b-HCG, alpha-fetoprotein and LDH), which were normal. Macroscopically, the section surface of the orchiectomy specimen showed thickening of the tunica albuginea, with haemorrhagic areas. The testicular parenchyma was increased in consistency, with the presence of whitish fibrous tracts and yellowish plaques on section. Microscopic examination revealed marked hypospermatogenesis with hyalinisation of the seminiferous tubules, as well as a chronic inflammatory process, consisting of histiocytes, abundant plasma cells and giant cells. Within some of these cells, characteristic Michaelis-Gutmann bodies with an owl's eye appearance were recognised, which were positive for Von Kossa staining, demonstrating their calcium composition and thus suggesting the diagnosis of MLP. These inflammatory changes also partially affected the epididymis. With the diagnosis of testicular and epididymal PML, treatment was completed with a course of fluoroquinolones for 3 months, after which the evolution is satisfactory and the patient is asymptomatic.   "
"Male patient, aged 28 years, seen in urology for presenting left varicocele. In the study of this pathology, a large mass dependent on the left kidney was discovered, which displaced the abdominal structures; the left renal vein and cava were observed to be displaced, but permeable. Clinically, the patient reported abdominal pain, asthenia and weight loss. There was no haematuria or voiding syndrome. Physical examination revealed a large abdominal mass. Laboratory tests (routine blood tests, blood and urine biochemistry, coagulation) were normal. Testicular ultrasound confirmed a large left varicocele; abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a mass in the left kidney, measuring 25 × 20 ×14 cm in maximum diameter, compressing and displacing abdominal structures, as well as the renal and cava vein. The rest of the examination was normal (T2N0).  The study was completed with a bone scan (negative for bone metastases), a fine needle puncture-aspiration (atypical cells suspicious for malignancy) and an arteriography where displacement and rotation of the abdominal aorta was observed. In view of the results of the study, it was decided to perform a radical nephrectomy; the operation was uneventful and the postoperative period was favourable; the patient was discharged 7 days after surgery. The anatomical pathology report described macroscopically a large encapsulated tumour mass of 4,960 g, measuring 27 ×23 ×15 cm, where no kidney was recognised. The microscopic description confirmed the diagnosis of renal fibromyxoid sarcoma. Subsequent evolution Followed up in the outpatient clinic by the urology and oncology departments (which decided not to give complementary treatment), the patient was doing very well and all the complementary examinations carried out 9 months after the operation (blood and urine tests, thoracoabdominal CT scan) were normal. Three months later an extensive local recurrence was detected in the thoracoabdominal CT scan, a mass in the left renal cell with local extension (approximately 20 cm) affecting the spleen and pancreas, which it displaced but did not appear to infiltrate.  It was decided to treat with surgery for a large multiloculated tumour infiltrating the spleen, the tail of the pancreas, the greater gastric curvature and the left diaphragm. Resection of the tumour, including the affected diaphragm, vertical gastrectomy up to the angle of His, splenectomy with resection of the tail of the pancreas and splenic angle colectomy were performed. The anatomical pathology report confirmed that this was an abdominal and retroperitoneal recurrence of high-grade sarcoma, compatible with fibrosarcoma, adherent to the gastric wall, spleen and pancreas. Treatment was completed with chemotherapy (6 cycles of adriamycin/ifosfamide/monthly) and radiotherapy, which was well tolerated and responded (control CT scan within the normal range). After four months, a new relapse was observed in the abdominal CT scan, for which he received chemotherapy treatment and 8 months later the patient died.   "
"A 75-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. After presenting with mild lower urinary tract symptoms, a simple abdominal X-ray showed a right pelvic paravesical annular calcific image. In view of these findings, an abdominal CT scan was performed and two masses were observed, one 3 cm and the other 1.5 cm in diameter, with calcified walls, compatible with a retrovesical hydatid cyst, with no other findings in the abdomen or on the chest X-ray. The patient, from the beginning, has been asymptomatic, so periodic controls have been established by CT, and has remained unchanged over time; a mass of 2.5 cm in diameter, heterogeneous, persists in the pelvic cavity, which sits above the left seminal vesicle, along with another similar somewhat smaller one totally calcified in its periphery on the right side, related to his pelvic hydatid disease.   "
"An 81-year-old man was referred from the outpatient clinic to our urology department for symptoms of the lower urinary tract. He had a personal history of arterial hypertension treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, surgery for duodenal ulcus in 1961 and cholecystectomy in 2002. An infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was diagnosed by chance during the abdomino-pelvic ultrasound scan. The CT scan revealed that it did not affect the iliac bifurcation. The examination also showed that the kidneys had a morphology compatible with horseshoe kidneys, with an isthmus located at the level of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Our case reveals the most favourable situation, in principle, for the surgical approach, since the aneurysm originates distal, 4 cm from the exit of the main renal arteries, which are two, one for each renal half. There is no additional artery at the level of the isthmus. In successive controls, a progressive increase in the aortic diameter was observed, which, in a control CT scan, had reached a maximum diameter of 8 cm.  In view of these findings, the vascular surgery department decided to consider surgical treatment of the aneurysm. On physical examination, the patient preserved pulses and an expansive abdominal heartbeat was palpated. The rest of the examination was of no interest. As part of the preoperative protocol for aneurysms, a baseline echocardiogram and respiratory function tests were performed, all without significant alterations. A retroperitoneal approach was chosen with resection of the infrarenal aortic aneurysm and aorto-aortic bypass with a 16 mm Hemashield prosthesis, without intraoperative complications. And no lumbar or polar arteries were visualised. The postoperative course was normal, with no complications arising from the procedure, and the patient maintained adequate renal function. At discharge, all pulses were present. The patient was asymptomatic in terms of vascular alteration; he maintained all pulses in the lower extremities, with preserved renal function parameters and a control CT angiography 6 months after the operation showed aorto-aortic bypass without leaks or evidence of areas of aneurysmal dilatation.  An intravenous urography was also performed, showing the kidneys with horseshoe morphology, pyeloureteral junction in the anterior plane without significant alterations, as well as in the collecting systems.   "
"A 53-year-old male patient, diagnosed with ankylopoietic spondylitis (HLA B27), secondary amyloidosis and terminal chronic renal failure on replacement treatment with haemodialysis. He presented with painless haematuria and cystoscopy revealed a bladder mass, excrescent but not papillary and bleeding. Transurethral resection (TUR) was performed and the histological diagnosis was bladder amyloidosis. The patient evolved satisfactorily and after 11 months he was readmitted with intense, epigastric and fixed abdominal pain, to which was added two hours later a sudden, abundant and haematic vomiting, which was complicated by cardiorespiratory arrest, leading to exitus (11/04/1995). Post-mortem anatomopathological diagnosis revealed ischaemic necrosis of the digestive tract in the territory irrigated by the superior mesenteric artery and amyloid deposits in the submucosal vessels. Organ and system involvement was widespread, including bilateral renal atrophy due to amyloidosis. Bladder amyloidosis (AA), mostly perivascular and amyloidosis in prostatic vessels.  "
"An 84-year-old woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted urgently for abdominal pain and distension. With a diagnosis of subocclusive ileus, medical treatment was initially started. With no urological history, she began a few hours after urethral catheterisation with haematuria, which became very intense, evolving into the formation of a large bladder clot occupying the entire cavity, and perivesical fluid and gas were also observed on computed axial tomography. Urgent surgery was performed, revealing a section of ileum 1.5 m long up to 10 cm from the ileocaecal valve, with a violaceous oedematous appearance, which recovered and acquired a normal appearance, colour and peristalsis; The patient had a small fissure in the bladder wall, so a cystotomy was performed to drain the large clot, observing bleeding in the wall sheet and great friability of the wall, taking multiple biopsies and subsequently performing ligation of both hypogastric tubes. In the immediate postoperative period, after anuria and severe haemodynamic alteration, the patient died (09/05/2000). The anatomopathological diagnosis revealed that all the bladder biopsies performed showed vascular and interstitial amyloid (AA) deposits.  "
"A 74-year-old female patient, previously admitted on several occasions with diagnoses of bronchiectasis and peribronchiectatic pneumonitis, severe multifactorial anaemia, chronic renal insufficiency, endoscopic signs of chronic diffuse gastritis, with positive rheumatoid factor. As a result of a casual fall, he fractured his left humerus and hip on the same side. During his admission to Traumatology he presented a picture of macroscopic haematuria (post-condensation), hypotension, febrile fever, worsening renal function, which forced his transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, where he died with the diagnosis of pneumonia evolved to pulmonary abscess, fulminant haematuria, pseudomonas sepsis and acute renal failure (13/07/2004). Previously, as a result of the presence of a bladder clot that occupied the entire lumen, endoscopic drainage was performed with observation of a denuded and inflamed bladder wall with bleeding in sheet without tumour pathology, taking multiple biopsies. The pathological diagnosis revealed bladder amyloidosis (AA) with deposits of amyloid material, mainly perivascular, but also stromal.   "
"The patient was admitted to our unit at 45 days of life (day 0) for moderate to severe dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis. Interesting data include: preterm newborn of 32 weeks gestational age with adequate birth weight (2,060 g) and Down's syndrome, diagnosed in the first week of life of TF. Prior to admission he had not presented any hypoxic crisis. His weight curve was adequate. Ultrasound (Sonos 100 CF, Hewlett Packard, Massachusetts, USA) showed a pulmonary stenosis gradient of 70 mmHg, baseline O2 saturation was 92% with O2 at 0.5 bpm in nasal goggles, non-invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranged between 50 and 55 mmHg (50-90 percentile for his age). On the third day he presented acute hypovolaemic shock due to severe diarrhoea, requiring volume expansion, intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation (MV). After a good clinical response, the patient was extubated after 6 hours with good clinical and gasometric tolerance. On the fifth day he started with progressive dyspnoea, cyanosis, bilateral crackles without wheezing, requiring reintubation and connection to MV (Babylog 8000 plus, Dräger Medizintechnik GMBH. Lübeck, Germany). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) testing in nasal mucus was negative. On day 8 he developed progressive oligoanuria with generalised oedema (maximum weight gain of 16% on day 9) and increased oxygen requirements (FiO2: 100%), with significant decrease in lung compliance and severe refractory hypoxaemia (transcutaneous saturation < 70%). Invasive MAT remained higher than 45 mmHg (5th percentile for her age: 43 mmHg): there was no pathological thermal gradient or coagulopathy. On auscultation, the heart murmur changed characteristics, becoming shorter and less intense (suggestive of suprasystemic PPH). Prone ventilation achieved only slight improvement for 2-3 hours (oxygenation index [OI] from 19 to 16) and the patient could not tolerate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increases greater than 8 cmH2O (desaturation and systemic hypotension). After ruling out infundibular spasm by ultrasound and verifying PPH (reversal of ventricular septal defect [VSD] shunt), treatment was started with ONI at 40 bpm. Subsequently, after a good response, it was maintained at 20 bpm. ONI and nitrous oxide (NOxPUMP plus, Bedfont Scientific Ltd, Upchurch Kent, England) were continuously monitored, the latter being maintained in ranges below 3 ppm.  The patient was also treated with dopamine perfusion at 8 µg/kg/minute. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and mild pulmonary oligoperfusion. Bronchoalveolar lavage isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antibiotic treatment was started. On day 12, resolution of the acute renal failure and oedema was observed, without having received treatment with renal function replacement agents. From day 30, a progressive improvement in respiratory dynamics was observed, tolerating the progressive weaning of ONI (previously it had not been possible to reduce it to less than 15 ppm because the patient could not tolerate it). On day 35 the patient was extubated.   "
"A 44-year-old man with a previous history of depression and alcoholism was taken to a regional hospital three hours after voluntary ingestion of arsenic. The patient was found to be agitated, with nausea, vomiting and severe watery diarrhoea. His blood pressure was 75/45 mmHg, his heart rate was 130 beats/minute and his temperature was 37ºC. Blood tests showed acute metabolic acidosis (pH 7.21, PO2 91 mmHg, PCO2 21 mmHg and bicarbonate 11.8 mmol/l with FiO2 of 0.21), lactate 6 (normal level: < 2.2) mmol/l and hypokalaemia 3.3 mmol/l. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia at 135 beats/minute and QTc interval of 0.46 seconds. He was initially treated with sodium bicarbonate (220 mmol intravenously [i.v.]), fluid overload, gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal and dimercaprol (300 mg intramuscularly [i.m.]). Due to a progressive deterioration of the level of consciousness, the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. On admission, the patient was sedated and mechanically ventilated. Physical examination revealed miosis and a temperature of 35.2°C, a blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg, a heart rate of 95 beats/minute and a central venous pressure of 8 cmH2O. The most salient analytical data were: glucose 64 mg/dl, sodium 148 mmol/l, potassium 1.8 mmol/l, calcium 7.8 mg/dl, magnesium 2.7 mg/dl, phosphorus 0.4 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 mg/dl, urea 52 mmol/l, creatine kinase 273 U/l, troponin I 0.74 (normal level: 0.06) µg/l, leucocytes 17.6 x 109/l with 80% neutrophils and haemoglobin 12.5 g/dl. Arterial blood gases were (FiO2, 0.5): pH 7.27, PO2 105 mmHg, PCO2 38 mmHg and bicarbonate 18 mmol/l. Chest X-ray was within normal limits. ECG showed sinus rhythm at 95 beats/minute, prolonged QTc interval (0.70 seconds) and ST-segment depression in leads I, II, aVL and V2 to V6. Several minutes later, ECG recording revealed several episodes of polymorphic and self-limited ventricular tachycardias compatible with PAD, which were suppressed with magnesium and potassium supplementation. Due to the onset of acute renal failure, a haemodialysis session was performed. Eight hours after admission, a pulmonary arterial catheter revealed the following haemodynamic parameters: pulmonary arterial pressure, 28/20 mmHg; pulmonary wedge pressure, 12 mmHg; cardiac index, 4.7 beats/minute/m2 and systemic vascular resistances, 435 dynes.sec.cm-5. He was treated with aggressive volume expansion, dimercaprol administration (3.2 mg/kg/4 hours), phosphorus repletion and high-dose noradrenaline. Subsequently, blood pressure rose to 120/65 mmHg and systemic vascular resistances reached 1019 dynes.sec.cm-5. Serum arsenic levels obtained on admission were 319 (normal level: < 20) µg/l and urinary arsenic levels were 946 (normal level: < 35) µg/l. An ECG performed 24 hours after admission revealed a normal QTc interval (0.40 sec) and an absence of Q waves and ST segment shifts. At this time, serum troponin I levels were 25.6 µg/l and serum creatine kinase levels were 1523 (MB fraction 98.1) U/l. After 48 hours of admission, the patient developed a fever of 40°C and severe arterial hypotension due to pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca and Serratia marcescens. The patient died 60 hours after admission. A partial autopsy revealed histological signs of massive renal necrosis, hepatic centrolobulillar necrosis and, at the cardiac level, absence of acute myocardial infarction, coronary thrombosis or typical signs of myocarditis (myocytolysis and lymphocyte infiltration).   "
"We present the case of a 49-year-old male patient; 4 months before admission to our hospital he underwent vascular surgery with aorto-biliac replacement for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. One week prior to admission to the Intensive Care Unit, he presented episodes of proctorrhagia with increasing volumes. After secondary haemodynamic decompensation, admission to the Intensive Care Unit was indicated. She also reported the presence of severe periumbilical and hypogastric colic pain, haematocrit of 13% and incoercible bleeding, so emergency abdominal surgery was indicated on suspicion of AFE, since the abdominal ultrasound performed hours earlier reported a linear image above the umbilical scar compatible with vascular prosthesis, with a hypoechogenic area of 87 x 67 x 71 mm surrounding it. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a retroperitoneal haematoma surrounding the previous prosthesis and FAE with jejunum 60 cm from the fixed loop and sigmoid colon. He presented cardiorespiratory arrest and died in the operating theatre.  "
"A 73-year-old male patient, smoker of 55 packets of cigarettes a year, with no known drug allergies and no previous treatment. He was admitted for ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI), complicated 72 hours later by post-infarction angina. A haemodynamic study revealed 90% obstruction in the right coronary artery (RCA), 70% in the anterior descending (AD), 90% in the first diagonal, 70% in the bisector and 70% in the circumflex (CX). Catheterisation showed an ejection fraction of 75% with normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. At the medical-surgical session, the patient was accepted for surgery, and treatment was started with carvedilol, captopril, amlodipine, simvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid. After 30 days, a planned myocardial revascularisation was performed using saphenous vein to CD and diagonal vein and mammary artery to DA grafts. During the procedure, an ECC time of 112 minutes, an ischaemia time of 76 minutes and a hypothermia of 29°C was achieved. Anaesthesia was induced with etomidate and cisatracurium and maintained with midazolam (5-7.5 mg/hour), cisatracurium (2.5-5 mg/hour), and remifentanil (0.01-0.02 µg. kg-1. min-1). Standard cardiopulmonary bypass with pulsatile flow was used. Heparin activity was antagonised with protamine. Pump output was normal, and there were no intraoperative incidents. On admission to the Intensive Care Unit, he showed the following haemodynamic parameters: mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 77 mmHg, with dobutamine perfusion at 4.5 µg kg-1 min-1, heart rate of 80 l/min, pulmonary artery pressure of 31/20 mmHg, PVC of 18 mmHg and PCP of 16 mmHg. Cardiac output (CO) was 6.8 l/min, with a cardiac index (CI) of 3.35 l/min/m2. Within 2 hours of evolution, the patient developed haemodynamic deterioration, with marked hypotension despite adding noradrenaline perfusion at 0.4 µg kg-1.min-1 and increasing the dose of dobutamine to 8 µg kg-1.min-1. He maintained diuresis, remained afebrile and well adapted to maximal ventilation. Mediastinal drains were scanty. Plain chest X-ray showed no evidence of parenchymal condensation, the Swan-Ganz catheter was in the correct position and there were no changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG). A total of 2,200 cc of crystalloids and colloids were administered in one hour, i.e. about 30 ml/kg (weight: 70 kg) and noradrenaline perfusion was increased above 0.5 µg kg-1 min-1 without any response. Dobutamine infusion was maintained at the same doses. Sedation was performed with low doses of midazolam. Echocardiographic monitoring ruled out other complications. Core temperature was 35°C and there was no early rewarming, according to the usual pattern. In the presence of data compatible with postoperative vasoplegia refractory to treatment, it was decided to use methylene blue. However, blood cultures were taken and were negative. In addition to requesting the corresponding consents, the relatives were informed of the use of this medication. The haemodynamic parameters measured with the pulmonary artery catheter before and at various times after methylene blue infusion are shown in table 1. A dramatic haemodynamic response was observed at the time of infusion, which was sustained over time. It allowed withdrawal of noradrenaline, normalised MAT and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). No changes in arterial blood gases were recorded.  Methylene blue was administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg diluted in 250 cc of 5% glucose saline, to be given over 60 minutes. No adverse effects of interest were observed, except for urine staining. There was no renal failure, maintaining normal urea and creatinine values and preserved diuresis. Haemoglobin levels were unchanged and there were no alterations in coagulation or liver failure. The level of methaemoglobinaemia was not determined, although this adverse effect, like the others, has been described with the use of doses much higher than those used in our case. After stabilisation, the patient was extubated 24 hours after admission, and discharge was extended preventively until 72 hours, with no new complications arising. Hospital discharge occurred 11 days later and no late complications were observed.   "
"A 42-year-old man, drinker of more than 100 g of ethanol per day, with no other history of interest, reported a 3-day history (coinciding with an increase in habitual alcohol intake) of fever, jaundice, abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium and abdominal distension. Physical examination revealed frank muco-cutaneous jaundice, grade I encephalopathy and ascites. No enlargement of the liver or spleen was observed. Cardiorespiratory auscultation was normal. Laboratory tests on admission showed the following results: leukocytes 26,820 per µl (neutrophils, 77%), prothrombin activity 40%, plasma creatinine 1.9 mg/dl; urea 91mg/dl; total bilirubin 21mg/dl; AST 164 U/l; ALT 103 U/l; GGT 152 UI/dl. Hepatic viral markers were negative. Chest X-ray showed a right basal alveolar infiltrate and abdominal ultrasound showed a small liver with increased echogenicity and homogeneous structure; normal bile duct; patent portal vein, splenomegaly, abundant ascites. Computed axial tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a small liver with lobulated contour. With the clinical diagnosis of acute alcoholic hepatitis on chronic liver disease with severity criteria and a Maddrey score of 71, he was admitted to the gastrointestinal department. Treatment was started with corticosteroids, enteral nutrition and empirical antibiotic therapy. On the fifth day of stay, progression of hepatic encephalopathy to grade III and acute renal failure in the context of type I hepatorenal syndrome was observed. Laboratory tests showed a worsening of renal function with plasma creatinine values of 4.19 mg/dl; urea 140 mg/dl and total bilirubin 35.3 mg/dl, with persistent elevated transaminase values and alteration in prothrombin time. Pentoxifylline (as anti-TNF therapy), terlipressin and albumin (as treatment for type I SHR) and MARS were added to the treatment, after requesting informed consent. We performed 3 sessions, every other day, with admission of the patient to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for each session. The approximate duration of each session was 12 hours or until filter coagulation. Femoral venous access was used exclusively for this purpose. The associated renal replacement technique was continuous veno-venous HDF. Anticoagulation was variable with epoprostenol sodium 5 ng/kg/minute, with heparin Na 5U/kg/hour or with both. The patient was haemodynamically stable during the sessions, with no notable incidents.   "
"A 9-year-old boy with pharyngitis for 7 days, and high fever and arthralgias in the 48 hours prior to admission. After 12 hours on the ward, he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in a dazed state, with punctate petechial rash predominantly in the root of the limbs, poor peripheral perfusion, hypotension, tachycardia, increased work of breathing, desaturation and oligoanuria. Complementary examinations revealed leukopenia (3,600/mm3), plateletopenia (22. 000/mm3), C-reactive protein (11.96 mg/dl), Na+: 131 mEq/l, creatinine: 2.35 mg/dl, in anuria; coagulopathy with activated partial thromboplastin time: 58 sec (control: 30 sec), prothrombin time: 31 sec (control: 11 sec), Quick's index: 20%, fibrinogen: 269 mg/dl; antithrombin-III activity: 30%; liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase: 306 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase: 184 IU/l, total bilirubin: 9 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 6 mg/dl), metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.19, HCO3-: 16 mEq/l; EB: -10 mEq/l; lactate: 13 ng/dl and chest X-ray with bilateral alveolo-interstitial involvement. Expansion, administration of sodium bicarbonate, antibiotics (cefotaxime and teicoplanin) and catecholamine perfusion (dopamine 5 µg/kg/min and noradrenaline up to 8 µg/kg/min) were started. Intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation was required due to worsening gas exchange with high respiratory support. Continuous venovenous haemofiltration was started due to renal failure and blood volume overload. The evolution was unfavourable towards refractory multiple organ failure (MOF), producing asystole and cardiorespiratory arrest, with exsitus 12 hours after admission. S. pyogenes serotype M1T1 was isolated in blood culture and bronchial aspirate.   "
"The patient was a 31-year-old male, smoker of 30 cigarettes a day with no other history of interest, who was admitted to the Emergency Department reporting weight loss (approximately 10 kg), asthenia and dry cough for the last 6 months. Ten days prior to admission, he had a fever of up to 39ºC, generalised myalgia and dyspnoea on moderate exertion. The admission blood test showed a baseline arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) of 63 mmHg; erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 92 mm/h; white blood cell count of 9300 l/mm3 (73% neutrophils); lactic dehydrogenase (LDH): 957 mg/dl, and fibrinogen: 954 mg/dl. Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse interstitial-alveolar infiltrate over the lung parenchyma. Chest CT showed extensive involvement of the lung parenchyma with areas of alveolar involvement, symmetrical and bilateral areas of ground-glass opacity and adenopathies in the pulmonary hilum, paratracheal and below the carina. The patient underwent a transbronchial biopsy, which was non-specific. A lung biopsy was performed in the operating theatre and the histological study showed alveolar proteinosis. The microbiological study of the biopsy isolated Nocardia sp. Fifteen days after admission, the patient presented clinical worsening with a large increase in dyspnoea, hypoxia and worsening of the alveolar-arterial gradient. Given the clinical situation, it was decided to perform bilateral bronchoalveolar lavage. Prior to orotracheal intubation, the patient was sedated with propofol, analgesiated with fentanyl and relaxed with succinylcholine. Intubation was performed with a left Mallinckrodt 39F double-lumen tube. We checked the location of the tube by means of a paediatric fibrobronchoscope. The patient was then kept sedated and relaxed with continuous perfusion of propofol and cisatracurium. We initially ventilated the patient for 30 minutes in pressure control, with inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 100%, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cm H2O, peak pressure of 30 cm H2O and respiratory rate of 12. The patient had tidal volumes of 800 ml (volume/minute of 10 lpm) and his oxygenation was 96%. We then measured the static compliance of each lung (25 ml/cm H2O in the right lung and 15 ml/cm H2O in the left lung), so we decided to start lavage in the left lung (the one with the worst static compliance) with the patient in the supine position. The lavage was performed with isotonic saline solution heated to 37ºC. We infused one litre from a height of 30-40 cm above the patient and drained the patient by gravity. The same operation was carried out until the lavage fluid had cleared. Thirteen litres were necessary in this first phase. To achieve a better result and drainage, thoracic percussion was performed on the lavaged lung. At the end of the lavage in the supine position, we observed an improvement in the static compliance of the left lung of up to 53 ml/cm H2O and an improvement in saturation of up to 98%. The patient was then placed in prone position. We performed the same procedure as in the supine position, in this case 15 litres of saline solution at 37°C were necessary to obtain a clear drainage. The total time taken to lavage the left lung was 2 hours and 45 minutes. After completion of the left lung lavage, we ventilated both lungs in pressure control mode with FiO2 100%, PEEP 10 cm H2O and peak pressure of 35 cm H2O for 45 minutes. The measured static compliance was 39 ml/cm H2O and oxygen saturation was 96%. We decided to ventilate the left lung alone, to check that he could tolerate right lung lavage. The patient was well tolerated with an oxygen saturation of 96%. We decided to start the lavage of the right lung starting in prone position. In this position the drain started to clear with 20 litres of saline in one hour and 35 minutes. We changed to the supine position, and in this position only 4 litres were needed in 14 minutes to obtain a clear drainage. After 30 minutes of mechanical ventilation the static compliance of both lungs was 64 ml/cm H2O and the oxygen saturation was 98%. Finally we changed the double lumen tube to a standard number 8 tube and started disconnecting the patient. The patient was extubated two hours after completion of the lavage. The control chest X-ray showed a bilateral fine interstitial pattern. When the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit he had a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 453.8 (193.8 on admission). Sequential lavage had to be repeated twice during the following year due to worsening of his disease with good tolerance.   "
"A 58-year-old woman presented to hospital with pain in the popliteal fossa and vomiting of 48 hours' duration. Her history included DM, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, congestive heart failure and depression. On admission, vital signs were normal and examination showed signs of deep vein thrombosis. Blood tests showed normal ionic, haematological, renal and hepatic function. The patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities by ultrasound and was treated with NPH insulin, metformin (850 mg/12 hours), enoxaparin, torasemide, enalapril, dipotassium clorazepate, allopurinol, mirtazapine and digoxin. During the first two days, the patient continued to vomit and hardly ingested any liquids, and 24 hours later, she reported abdominal pain with asthenia, vomiting, visual disturbances and oliguria. On the fifth day of admission, the patient suffered cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and, after being resuscitated by the intensivist, she was mydriatic, anauric and with a Glasgow scale score of 3. Blood pressure was 120/45 mmHg (with noradrenaline), heart rate was 115 beats/minute and temperature was 36°C. The most significant analytical data are shown in table 2. During the first hours he received fluids, 500 mEq of sodium bicarbonate and noradrenaline, which restarted diuresis, but arterial blood gas did not improve (pH 6.90 and bicarbonate 7.1 mEq/l). A haemodialysis session improved metabolic acidosis (pH 7.28 and bicarbonate 16 mEq/l) and hyperkalaemia (5.2 mEq/l). After overcoming aspiration pneumonia, the patient was transferred to the ward in a vegetative state and died on the 19th day of admission.  "
"A 74 year old woman was admitted to hospital for obnubilation and anuria after presenting for 5 days with abdominal pain and vomiting. Her history included DM treated with metformin (850 mg/8 h) and glibenclamide. Blood pressure was 105/60 mmHg, heart rate was 155 beats/minute and temperature 36.7ºC. Examination revealed severe dehydration, disorientation, Kussmaul's respiration, abdominal pain with weak peristalsis and absence of abdominal defence. Table 2 shows the main analytical data, highlighting in addition a hyperamylasaemia of 2,605 U/l. An abdominal CT scan revealed an enlarged pancreatic head suggestive of acute pancreatitis. After discontinuation of metformin administration, the patient was intubated orotracheally and connected to a mechanical ventilator. She also received fluid therapy with potassium supplementation, noradrenaline, bicarbonate, insulin, amiodarone, imipen and furosemide. On the second day of admission, after administering 750 mEq of bicarbonate and 140 mEq of potassium, acid-base balance (pH 7.41 and bicarbonate 20 mEq/l) and water-electrolyte balance (sodium 147 mEq/l, potassium 3.5 mEq/l) normalised and creatinine decreased to 5.5 mg/dl. On the third day of admission, due to the presence of repeated mucous stools, a colonoscopy was performed which revealed a sessile polypoid formation located next to the anal sphincter and measuring 14 cm in length. The endoscopic specimen was reported as a villous adenoma of the rectum. On the seventh day of admission the patient was extubated, and two days later she was transferred to the ward for removal of the adenoma.  "
"A 61-year-old woman transferred from a regional hospital due to acute renal failure. The patient reported severe diarrhoea and vomiting for a week. Her history included arterial hypertension and DM treated with irbesartan, amlodipine and metformin (850 mg/12 h). Examination revealed severe dehydration, tachypnoea and bradypsychia, although he was responsive to commands. The abdomen was soft and non-painful. Blood pressure was 90/40 mmHg, heart rate 70 beats/minute and temperature 35.8ºC. Table 2 shows the main analytical data. Serum amylase was 94 U/l. Fluid intake normalised blood pressure and the administration of 165 mEq of bicarbonate raised pH to 7.06 and bicarbonate to 4 mEq/l. The patient underwent urgent haemodialysis and metformin treatment was discontinued. Twelve hours after admission, creatinine was 2.2 mg/dl and pH 7.43, but amylase rose to 1,319 U/l, with normal ionic calcium and triglycerides. An abdominal CT scan revealed peripancreatic fatty infiltration with free abdominal fluid compatible with acute pancreatitis. No known causes of pancreatitis were found, including hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercalcaemia, alcoholism, biliary lithiasis or trauma. The patient progressed favourably and was transferred to the ward 72 hours after admission.   "
"A 54-year-old man was admitted to hospital with an episode of chest pain lasting one hour. The ECG showed Q waves together with E-ST in inferior leads and D-ST in leads I, aVL and V4-V5. In right precordial leads a marked J-wave followed by a convex and descending D-ST ending in a negative T-wave could also be observed. With the diagnosis of inferior AMI he received fibrinolytic treatment with tenecteplase. One hour later the ECG, recorded with mild precordial pain, revealed no inferior ST-segment elevation, a negative T-wave in aVL and a J-point elevation > 0.2 mV with descending ST-segment and negative T-wave in leads V1-V2, suggesting an electrocardiographic pattern of SB. Five hours later the ECG showed a prominent J-wave with convex and saddle E-ST in leads V1 and V2, respectively. There was also a J-point elevation associated with a positive E-ST and T-wave in leads V3-V4. Three days after admission the ECG revealed an inferior qR pattern along with a negative T wave in leads III and aVF, a manifest J wave in leads V1-V2, a concave E-ST with positive T wave in leads V2-V3, and no S wave in the left leads. He had no ventricular arrhythmias during hospitalisation. The peak values of creatine kinase and troponin I were 1,398 U/l and 23.2 ng/ml, respectively. Coronary arteriography revealed a proximal (95%) stenosis of the right coronary artery and a stent was placed. After discharge, 6 months later he underwent a flecainide challenge test (2 mg/kg intravenously over 10 minutes) which was negative for a diagnosis of SB.   "
"A 60-year-old man came to hospital with precordial pain lasting two hours. The ECG revealed a subepicardial lesion current compatible with an inferior AMI, a pronounced J-point depression together with a descending D-ST in leads V1-V2 and a horizontal D-ST in V3 to V5. Fibrinolytic treatment with tenecteplase and lidocaine was administered for extrasystolic ventricular tachycardia. One and a half hours later the ECG, recorded without pain, revealed a marked J wave in leads V1-V2 and no ST segment shift. One day later the ECG revealed an inferior T-wave inversion, a J-wave in leads V1-V2 and a concave E-ST with positive T-waves in leads V2 to V4. Creatinine kinase rose to 1,143 U/l (with a MB fraction of 102). An echocardiogram revealed inferobasal akinesia. The clinical course in hospital was uneventful. Four years after discharge the ECG showed a J wave in inferior and anterior leads, and a concave E-ST with positive T wave in leads V2 to V4 suggestive of a PRRS.   "
"A 43-year-old man was admitted to hospital with severe precordial pain lasting one hour. The ECG showed mild inferior E-ST, prominent J wave in V1-V2 and marked D-ST in leads V1 to V5. Diagnosed with inferoposterior AMI, the patient received thrombolytic treatment with reteplase. One hour later the ECG revealed an incomplete BRD, an overt J wave (R') in leads V1-V2 and no ST-segment deviations. There were also high R-waves affecting the initial part of the QRS complex and acuminate T-waves in leads V2-V3, suggesting the diagnosis of subsequent superimposed AMI. Eight hours after admission the ECG revealed a T-wave inversion in leads III and aVF, a J-wave in leads V1-V2 and a concave E-ST with positive T-wave in leads V1 to V4. Three days later the ECG revealed a J-wave, a concave E-ST and a positive T-wave in leads V2 to V5 suggestive of PRRS. Creatinine kinase rose to 4,999 U/l (with a MB fraction of 254). An echocardiogram revealed inferobasal and apical akinesia. Coronary arteriography revealed a 90% stenosis in the middle third of the right coronary artery and 60% stenosis in the proximal portion of the circumflex artery. Following stenting of the right coronary artery, the patient has been asymptomatic for three years.   "
"A girl aged 18 months and 10 kg was transferred from her hospital of origin due to septic shock (maximum noradrenaline 1.5 µg/kg/min, mechanical ventilation 21 days, DIC); APD was started 40 hours after admission due to anuria, increase in creatinine (baseline 0.7 mg/dl, later 2.3 mg/dl) and balance of +2,360 ml. DPA was started on day 2 with 1.36% fluid, 10 ml/kg per hour, 20 minutes, with D/P ratios of urea, creatinine and Dt/Do glucose of 0.91, 0.83 and 0.33, respectively, with effective ultrafiltration between 405 and 700 ml/day. To obtain a negative net balance we had to increase the dialysate concentration to 3.27%. We observed that with a volume of 15 ml/kg and 10 minutes dwell time at 3.27%, the value of the ratios was 0.51, 0.47 and 0.41 (the clearance of substances was not excessive, but we still had sufficient osmotic gradient), so we increased the dwell time to 15 and then to 20 minutes with the following D/P ratios for urea, creatinine and Dt/Do glucose: 0.65, 0.61, 0.41, and 0.75, 0.59, 0.35 respectively, with stabilisation of the upward trend of creatinine at 4 mg/dl. On day 21, cloudy dialysate was observed with low cellularity and increased protein, so we reduced the concentration of the liquid to 2.27% and left it for 4 hours with 15 ml/kg per pass and 4 passes per day (in peritonitis it is recommended to increase the time of permanence and reduce the concentration of the infused solution4). In these circumstances, the values of the D/P ratios of urea, creatinine and Dt/Do glucose were 1.04, 0.85 and 0.14 respectively, so we reduced the duration to 2 hours, 6 daily passes with the same volume and type of liquid, obtaining ratios of 1.01, 0.76 and 0.23 with a decrease in 36 h of creatinine from 4.2 mg/dl to 3.3 mg/dl (renal function of 6.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 by urinary creatinine clearance and 9 ml/min/1.73 m2 by Schwarz formula). On day 27 with 6 daily passes with 1.36% glucose at 15 ml/kg and 2 hours dwell time the ratios were 1.04, 0.92 and 0.13, so we reduced to 90 minutes dwell time and then 60 minutes, being able to increase the number of daily passes to 9, obtaining ratios of 0.98, 0.88 and 0.38 (with 60 minutes dwell time we obtained the same clearance as with 120 minutes dwell time); by being able to make more passes we would improve clearance and ultrafiltration), and a decrease in creatinine from 2.7 to 1.8 mg/dl (renal function of 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 by urinary creatinine clearance and 19 ml/min/1.73 m2 by Schwarz formula), which made it possible to suspend DPA.   "
A 27-year-old man was admitted for polytraumatism after falling from a height of 15 metres. He was treated at the scene of the accident with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 points and haemodynamic stability was achieved. In the TACHT a pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta in the isthmus and accompanying periaortic haematoma were diagnosed. The associated lesions in all cases are described in table 1. The patient was treated with labetalol for strict blood pressure control. The 24-hour and one-week follow-up TTE scans of the aortic lesion were unchanged. On the ninth day he was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and on the 28th day after the accident a stent was placed in the descending thoracic aorta via the left primitive iliac artery with asymptomatic occlusion of the left subclavian artery.   
"The patient was a 31-year-old male who was involved in a motorbike accident. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening. CTHT on admission showed a pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery outlet with significant periaortic and mediastinal haematoma associated with bilateral haemothorax.  He was admitted to the ICU, where strict blood pressure control was achieved. Eight hours after the trauma, a stent was placed in the descending thoracic aorta via the left iliac route. The left subclavian artery was partially occluded without clinical repercussions. After 24 hours he was discharged to the ward and a week later he was discharged from hospital, as he was asymptomatic.   "
"The patient was a 35-year-old male who was involved in a motorbike accident. CTHT on admission showed a 7 mm intimal laceration of the thoracic aorta after the brachiocephalic trunk exit. The patient underwent decompressive right parietal craniotomy and evacuation of a subdural haematoma as a matter of urgency. Treatment with intravenous labetalol was started for strict control of the TAS and management of the associated lesions was prioritised due to their severity. One week after admission, the TTE showed an improvement compared to that at admission. 15 days later, magnetic angiography (angio-MRI) showed a normal distribution of the outflow of the supra-aortic trunks with no images suggestive of traumatic rupture of the aorta. One month after admission he was discharged home.   "
"This is a 45-year-old male patient with a history of smoking and hypercholesterolemia, suffering from severe acute coronary artery disease who underwent quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting with extracoronary circulation. Transesophageal echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 8-10%. The patient was intubated and kept on mechanical ventilation for 9 days in the intensive care unit (ICU). After extubation, he began to experience increased respiratory frequency, reduced oxygen saturation and oxyhaemoglobin values, so he was reintubated and reconnected to the mechanical ventilator, which was maintained until the twelfth day, when it could be definitively withdrawn. Once the patient's condition stabilised, he was transferred to the cardiology department. On the eighth day on the ward he began to experience dyspnoea, stridor, intense respiratory work and tachypnoea, for which he was again transferred to the ICU. Given the symptoms of upper airway obstruction, an urgent fibrobronchoscopy was performed, which revealed complex tracheal stenosis. A cervical computed tomography (CT) scan showed tracheal stenosis at the proximal end of 66% at approximately 2 cm from the glottis with peritracheal fibrosis and a 5 mm lumen.  It was decided to perform rigid bronchoscopy to place a tracheal prosthesis. Rigid bronchoscopy was combined with Nd-YAG laser therapy on the lesion and subsequent mechanical resection with a rigid bronchoscope. After tracheal recanalisation, a silicone prosthesis (Dumon 14/40) is placed, which is correctly anchored and permeable with the proximal end about 2.5 cm from the cords and the distal end about 7 cm from the carina. At the 7-day check-up, the prosthesis is still fully permeable and the respiratory symptoms have been definitively resolved.   "
"27-year-old woman, 27 weeks pregnant, wearing a seat belt, driver, who had a head-on collision with another vehicle during an overtaking manoeuvre, presented with cranioencephalic trauma with loss of consciousness. In the emergency department she presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15; 90 minutes after the accident she developed dysarthria and aphasia, with no obstetric involvement. She was admitted to the ICU 2h 15min after the accident, with motor aphasia, right proximal hemiplegia and right extensor plantar cutaneous reflex, cutaneous mark of the seat belt in the abdominal area and in the left lateral cervical region. A cranial CT scan and an extracranial Doppler ultrasound were performed without pathological findings. At 18h, a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and an angio-MRI of the supra-aortic trunks and intracranial vessels were performed, These showed an acute infarction in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery affecting the corpus striatum and the left frontoparietal corticosubcortical region, as well as a diffuse decrease in the calibre of the left ICA with severe stenosis of the C6-C7 supraclinoid segment, secondary to arterial dissection. Platelet antiplatelet therapy was started with 200mg of ASA. Subsequently a dead foetus was detected by ultrasound; a caesarean section was performed 24h later.  At hospital discharge, 2 weeks after the accident, she presented with minimal predominantly motor dysphasia, and 3/5 proximal hemiparesis in the right upper extremity and 0/5 distal hemiparesis in the right lower extremity.   "
"This is a 66-year-old man with a history of pulmonary neoplasia (stage iiiB non-small cell carcinoma) treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, who remained free of disease, with subsequent appearance of a brain metastasis on which complete resection was carried out pending the start of holocranial radiotherapy. He came to the emergency department with dyspnoea on minimal exertion for 10 days and fever of up to 39°C. She denied cough and expectoration. There was no epidemiological history of interest. He started antibiotic treatment on an outpatient basis without improvement. On arrival he presented severe respiratory failure requiring high FiO2 and was admitted to the critical care unit of our centre. He presented rapid progression of respiratory failure and at 24h required orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The initial chest X-ray showed an alveolar infiltrate in the left base with the appearance of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in subsequent controls. Pulmonary artery catheterisation ruled out heart failure, with pulmonary capillary pressure below 18mmHg, showing signs of moderate pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulation (D-dimer greater than 20,000ng/ml, maximum thrombocytopenia of 47,000/l and maximum prothrombin time of 1.58 ratio), acute renal failure with creatinine levels of up to 2.33mg/dl and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with maximum values of 2,305U/l. Antibiotic treatment was started empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin, and corticosteroids were subsequently added. Given the poor evolution, with persistent severe respiratory insufficiency and worsening of the pulmonary infiltrates of an unrelated cause, a thoracic CT scan was performed showing very extensive bilateral parenchymal involvement in ground glass, with a radiological appearance indicating diffuse alveolar damage or an infectious process of atypical characteristics. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with negative bacteriological culture, negative Ziehl-Nielsen and negative Pneumocystis jirovecii. Serology for atypical pneumonia (Legionella, Chlamydia, etc.) was requested and was negative. Finally, given the clinical characteristics and in a pandemic situation for the influenza A (H1N1) virus, probable infection by the virus was suspected, a nasal and pharyngeal swab was performed, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive, for which treatment with oseltamivir was added. The patient had a good clinical evolution with rapid improvement of the radiological infiltrates, and weaning from ventilation was carried out without incident. The patient was discharged after one month of hospitalisation.  None of the healthcare professionals who attended the patient presented symptoms indicative of influenza in the following days.   "
"This is a 70 year old woman with a history of AHT and recently diagnosed with neoplasia of the lower rectum, treated with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil analogue) and preoperative radiotherapy completed 2 months before surgery. She was admitted to the ICU after surgery (abdominoperineal amputation) due to suspected bronchoaspiration during anaesthetic induction with oximetric repercussions and ventilatory difficulties. She was sedoanalgesiated, intubated and connected to MV. Radiological findings showed no infiltrates indicative of parenchymal lung involvement. Initial evolution was good, and she was extubated without incident after 48h. She presented progressive worsening in the following 2 days radiologically (right basal parenchymal parenchymal involvement), gasometrically (non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) was required to maintain pulse oximetry at over 90%) and clinically (persistent tachypnoea with poor respiratory mechanics), so she was reintubated. She started with a persistent fever of over 39oC, resistant to antipyretics and physical measures. Microbiological samples were taken (blood culture, urine culture and bronchoaspirate). Antibiotic treatment started in the operating theatre was maintained. Laboratory tests showed a significant inflammatory reaction with C-reactive protein of 50mg/dl without leukocyte reaction (<10,000×103/μl). She remained intubated and connected to MV for 7 days, during which time fever persisted with peaks over 39oC, with radiological improvement without infiltrates and persistently negative microbiological samples; an abdominal CT scan was performed and complications derived from the surgery were ruled out. The patient was extubated afebrile, with compensated blood gases and good response to spontaneous respiratory tests; despite optimal conditions at the time of extubation, she had to be reintubated in 12 hours due to respiratory failure. She again began with high fever and repeated negative cultures, so fibrobronchoscopy was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and samples were sent to microbiology (culture and PCR for herpes, CMV and respiratory viruses) and pathological anatomy. Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed and the BAL results were received, showing early positive HSV-1 PCR (qualitative test) and, histologically, the presence of cells showing multinucleated nuclei, with ground-glass chromatin and intranuclear inclusions; immunocytochemically, nuclear positivity for herpes virus was found. Antiviral treatment was started with acyclovir 10mg/kg/8h i.v. with clinical improvement, disappearance of fever and progressive disconnection of the respirator until full respiratory autonomy.   "
"We present the clinical case of a 41-year-old woman with no history of interest, except for arterial hypertension, who presented at home with a sudden episode of severe headache in the occipital region, accompanied by a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness. She had presented similar episodes of headache in the previous week, although of lesser intensity, which subsided with anti-inflammatory drugs. The emergency services attended her at home, where orotracheal intubation was performed due to a low level of consciousness. She was transferred urgently to a hospital with neurosurgical services. On admission, a simple cranial computed tomography (CT) scan showed a right cerebellar intraparenchymal haemorrhage with a volume greater than 4 cm3, with discrete oedema and obliteration of the IV ventricle. It was decided to evacuate the haematoma and place an external ventricular drain. After surgery, he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He underwent deferred CT angiography and cerebral arteriography with no obvious vascular anomalies.  During his stay in the ICU, he had a torpid evolution due to intracranial hypertension during the first few days. After withdrawal of sedation, he awoke with an adequate level of consciousness and 48 hours later he was conscious; the neurological examination revealed nystagmus in all directions, bilateral facial paralysis, predominantly right tetraparesis, left dysmetria and predominantly right hyporeflexia with right extensor plantar cutaneous reflex. On the eighth day of her admission to the ICU, she was extubated in the morning and remained eupneic throughout the day with a normal ventilatory pattern. That same night she began to experience hypoventilation which led to severe respiratory acidosis and secondary respiratory arrest requiring intubation and MV. Given the clinical suspicion of respiratory centre involvement, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brainstem was performed, showing changes secondary to the evacuation of the right cerebellar haematoma and revealing lesions in the bulb and pons, which had not been seen in the previous control CT scan. It was decided to perform a percutaneous tracheostomy for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), which she required mainly at night. Finally, she was discharged to the ward where it was possible to close the tracheostoma and she continued with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) with nasobuccal mask.   "
"A 57-year-old man, with no past history of interest, attended the hospital emergency department for chest pain. Acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation in the anterior aspect of the heart was diagnosed and percutaneous coronary angiography was performed. The patient had a lesion in the middle portion of the anterior descending coronary artery, so angioplasty was performed and a stent was placed, without complications, after administering 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid, 300 mg of clopidogrel and 5,000 IU of intravenous heparin sodium. At the end of the procedure the patient was in Killip III and presented with massive haematemesis. Arterial O2 saturation was 92%, with a Ventimask at 50% 10 bpm. Digestive endoscopy was performed with respiratory support with CPAP-B, as per protocol described, and a Mallory Weiss lesion was observed. Haemoglobin dropped from 15.1 to 13g/dl and haematocrit from 43.6 to 39.1%. At the end of the procedure, the patient was 100% saturated and CPAP-B could be removed (arterial blood gas was not performed due to the risk of bleeding after administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents).   "
"A 56-year-old woman with a history of residual pulmonary tuberculosis, bladder carcinoma operated on twice and currently treated with local instillation of mitomycin, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and hyperuricaemia, for the last month on treatment with allopurinol, has attended the emergency department on several occasions over the last 10 days, for attacks of dyspnoea together with skin rash and has been treated from the beginning with high-dose corticosteroids, antihistamines and aerosol therapy. She was admitted to the ICU with suspected NET, presenting an erythematous maculopapular and blistering rash over 70% of the body surface, positive Nikolsky's sign, type I respiratory failure, mild renal failure and a tendency to hypotension. Supportive treatment and ciclosporin A were started. The patient has evolved favourably, the skin lesions have completely re-epithelialised 21 days after admission to the ICU, and she has been discharged to the ward.   "
"45-year-old man resuscitated from CRA after acute coronary syndrome in the street and transferred to hospital with absence of reflexes except for coughing and spontaneous breathing. After the hypothermia protocol, the same examination persisted, with generalised cerebral oedema seen in the cranial CT scan. On the third day of admission, the relatives were informed of the poor prognosis and spontaneously suggested donation. They were informed of the need to wait until the patient progressed to encephalic death, which they accepted. On the fifth day of admission, the same neurological examination continued. The family expressed their wish not to wait for encephalic death, requesting the withdrawal of life support. Donation through the LSTL and controlled asystole protocol was proposed to them, and they gave their consent. He was transferred to the operating theatre for terminal extubation. Asystole occurred 9 minutes after extubation and once death was certified, rapid laparotomy, cannulation and intraoperative cold perfusion were performed. ICT was 23 minutes. Both kidneys were explanted, the lungs were discarded by bronchoaspiration and the liver by TIC at the limit.   "
"T. I. is a 38-year-old woman who came to our unit, referred from the burns unit of another hospital in Barcelona, with a psychotic condition. The patient suffered burns following a fire at her home which required a month's stay in the unit. The patient reported no personal or family history of mental illness. She also denied the use of toxic substances. The only somatic antecedents that stood out were: delivery by caesarean section five months ago, infection of the surgical wound, and second and third degree burns from the aforementioned fire. In the patient's psychobiography, she was from Casablanca (Morocco) and the sixth of nine siblings (five boys and four girls). She attended school until the age of twenty with good performance (school and high school, plus 2 years of complementary education). Her socio-occupational adjustment in her country was good (various temporary jobs as a hostess, shop assistant, sports instructor, etc.). She got married in her country a year and a half ago by family agreement (she had never had a partner or male friends before) and a month later she moved to live in the province of Girona (Spain), where she lived with her husband, her brother-in-law and his wife. Since her marriage, the patient has been a housewife. Her first child (a boy) was born five months ago in a complicated delivery. Two months ago, a fire broke out in her home in unclear circumstances, which led to her admission to the burns unit of a hospital. On admission to our unit, the patient was vigilant, conscious and temporo-spatially disoriented. Contact with the patient was psychotic; her speech was sparse, in a low voice and with a monotonous tone of voice. She referred to a delirium of prejudice and paranoid delusions that she did not specify. She was suspicious. She reported hypothymia, dysthymia of fear, as well as auditory hallucinations in the form of ""noises"". The examination revealed a poor fixation memory. In subsequent interviews with the patient (several of them with the help of a translator), she reported that about two months after the birth she began to experience a mood disorder that oscillated between sadness or crying and elevated mood. She progressively developed delusions of harm towards herself and her child, as well as auditory hallucinations in the form of voices criticising her and giving her orders. In relation to these psychotic symptoms, the patient explained anguish and intense fear of being harmed (herself or her child) as well as her voluntary isolation as a protective measure. On examination in the hours prior to the fire, during the fire and during her stay in the burns unit, the patient explained fluctuations in her level of consciousness and memory loss, so that the suspicion of an extended suicide in the context of the hallucinatory-delusional symptoms could not be ruled out. During his stay in the acute unit, pharmacological treatment was started with Haloperidol up to 11.5 mg/d (with progressive reduction of the dose), Amisulpride (up to 800 mg/d) and Clonacepam. A few hours after admission she was alert, conscious and oriented. For the first few days the patient was still fearful and suspicious, hardly leaving her room. Slowly, contact, affection and psychotic symptoms improved; the hallucinations gradually disappeared and she gradually distanced herself from the delusional content until she was able to criticise it. He gradually adapted to the dynamics of the unit. Facilitating early and continuous contact with her son and leave from the family home was considered key to the patient's treatment and recovery; in fact, early mother-child contact was an important factor that accelerated the patient's recovery. The leaves were uneventful and the family was very cooperative at all times. On discharge the patient was euthymic, calm, free of positive psychotic psychopathology and able to take care of her child (although the amnesia secondary to the confusional disorder persisted). The patient and her family raised the possibility of her convalescence in Morocco, which we considered beneficial as she would be cared for by professionals with the same language and culture and would have the support of her family of origin; but we stressed the importance of moving with her son for the transfer to be truly therapeutic.   "
"A 65-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder type II treated with lithium and olanzapine attended the emergency department for behavioural alterations of four days' duration. The patient has a long history of several admissions to psychiatric services. She lives alone and is independent in her activities of daily living, although she receives home help. The family reports initial symptoms of mood swings and extravagant dress, which later evolved into dysarthria, difficulty in walking and temporo-spatial disorientation. In the study performed in the Emergency Department, arterial hypertension (174/110 mmHg), hypokalaemia (3.09 mEq/l), fever (38.4ºC) and abdominal distension were observed, which was attributed to urinary retention, and 2 litres of urine were extracted after bladder catheterisation. Lithemia, ECG, CK and cranial CT scan were normal, as were plain abdominal and chest X-rays. Lumbar puncture was performed with normal cell count. The patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department with a diagnosis of confusional syndrome with no known aetiology. She was treated with antipyretics, broad-spectrum antibiotics and venous thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin. The study was extended with a new lumbar puncture, cranial MRI, thoracic and abdominal-pelvic CT scan, blood and urine cultures, which showed no abnormalities that could justify the symptoms. Within two days, the patient developed mutism, akinesia, rigidity, distal tremor and decreased blinking. Fever and arterial hypertension (AHT) persist, with hypernatraemia (150mEq/l). Electrolyte disturbances are interpreted in the context of diaphoresis and no fluid and food intake. After deterioration of the level of consciousness, admission to the Resuscitation Unit was assessed and a nasogastric tube was placed for the patient's nutrition. Psychiatric assessment was requested and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was prescribed urgently for the following day with the diagnostic impression of malignant catatonia. Two days after the first session, the patient was found to have coherent spontaneous speech and was feeding. Two more sessions of ECT were administered and lithium was reintroduced. Fever, diaphoresis, hypertension, electrolyte disturbances and disorientation have subsided. The culture for Herpes Simplex Virus was negative, ruling out encephalitis due to this cause. The patient was discharged in 30 days with a diagnosis of TAB type II and malignant catatonia. At discharge the patient was euthymic.   "
"This is an 18 year old female patient, diagnosed (DSM-IV-TR) with social phobia and dependent personality disorder, referred from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CSMIJ) for follow-up in the adult service, who comes accompanied by her mother. She is the eldest of two sisters. Parents separated. Lives with her mother and sister. During her childhood she shows attention deficit and poor academic performance without repeating a grade. She is currently studying a higher module and is working in the family business. Medical history of interest: isolated growth retardation that required treatment with growth hormone (GH) from the age of 12 to 17 years. Fructose intolerance associated with digestive bleeding and lactose intolerance. In childhood, genetic examination was carried out, and no genetic alteration, neither numerical nor structural, was observed. She denies the use of toxic substances. Among the family psychiatric antecedents, the mother refers to long-standing anxious symptoms. The father is described as a solitary, introverted and ""unemotional"" person, characteristics that are present in several relatives in the paternal line. From the psychiatric point of view, the patient came into contact with the CSMIJ at the age of 14, with a diagnosis of Social Phobia. At the age of 17 she was admitted to the Day Hospital for 2 months due to difficulties in socialising, truancy and great dependence on the family environment. The diagnostic orientation was Social Phobia and Dependent Personality Disorder (according to evolution) which, after discharge, evolved towards partial improvement. Among the pre-morbid personality traits, she has a high degree of introversion. Her mother describes her as an isolated child, ""different"", with little social interest. Initial examination revealed distant contact, unspontaneous language with no formal alterations. Moderate psychophysical anxiety, obsessive hypochondriacal ideas, onychophagia and nocturnal bruxism. No symptoms of the affective or psychotic sphere were observed. No alterations in the course or content of thought. No alterations of sensory perception. Partial consciousness disorder. The picture is classified as a Cluster C Personality Disorder (phobic, obsessive and dependent traits). Pharmacological treatment is maintained as prescribed by CSMIJ (Sertraline, 100 mg), and she is referred to psychology to work on social difficulties. She made few visits with poor compliance with the proposed strategies (cognitive-behavioural model), and disengaged due to incompatibility with studies.  Second contact after two years The patient re-engages after almost two years (20 years) of no follow-up. Social difficulties persist. Exploratory visits are made by psychiatry and psychology, including a visit with the mother. They express the decision to abandon SSRI medication. They do not accept pharmacological treatment, although they do accept psychological treatment. During the assessment, the patient impresses a ""peculiar"" contact rather than the usual phobic-anxious contact. There is a strange - albeit subtle - alteration in eye contact. Language remains unspontaneous. In addition to social difficulties and little interest in the environment, obsessive hypochondriacal ideas and an absolute rejection of physical and sexual contact stand out. In order to assess the patient's difficulties/skills at the interpersonal level, simple social exposure exercises are proposed outside the consultation room. The patient does not carry out any of the proposed exercises/strategies. Nor does she show any concern for resolving these difficulties. On the contrary, she appears to be somewhat indifferent to them. In view of this, doubts begin to arise regarding social avoidance (uncomfortable vs. anxious?), and regarding the desire to socialise (learned social discourse?). Given these doubts, the suspicion arises that these symptoms could be explained by other diagnoses: schizoid traits? autistic spectrum traits? and so a new evaluation of the patient is proposed.  Assessment protocol and results: - Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (SCID II): - Criteria Schizoid Personality Disorder: 4/5. Close to cut-off point. - Criteria Avoidant Personality Disorder: 5/5. Meets cut-off point. - Theory of Mind Tests (TOM): - ""Happé Stories Test"": shows adequate ability to infer mental states in others, understand metaphors and double meanings. - ""Mind's Eye Reading Test"": Is able to attribute to the majority of items (23/36) the appropriate feeling or emotion shown in the photograph. - Screw-Up Test: Correctly identifies ""screw-up"" stories but shows difficulty in attributing emotional states and intentionality to characters. - Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III): IQ Verbal= 99 IQ Manipulative= 94 IQ Total= 97 Range: Medium - Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R): Disturbances in reciprocal social interaction are identified. Limited range of facial expressions to communicate and regulate social interaction. Inability to develop relationships with peers. A lack of socio-emotional reciprocity, inadequate social responses and a deficit in seeking to share pleasure with others are observed. In retrospect, qualitative alterations in communication are identified, such as a lack of spontaneous and varied symbolic play. Some restricted behaviour patterns are also identified. - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Cranial examination within normality.  Global assessment: Throughout the examination the patient is cooperative although not very motivated. The information obtained shows signs of an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) with low social interest, inappropriate expressions and behaviours, difficulties in establishing social relationships with peers, restricted facial expressions and affectivity, and limited interests/activities. The cognitive profile and performance in the 'TOM' domains (number of non-significant errors, although difficulty in attributing emotional states and intentionality to characters in the 'Meteduras de Pata' test) are consistent with the profile observed in high-functioning ASD patients (1).

"44-year-old single male, living with his mother and working in sheltered employment. Diagnosis of Residual Schizophrenia (F20.5, ICD-10) (11) in follow-up at his Mental Health Centre and with psychopharmacological treatment with 400 mg of amisulpi-ride, 10 mg of olanzapine and 10 mg of diazepam. Non-daily but sustained use of tramadol, cannabis, alcohol and cocaine. As somatic antecedents, he has difficulty in walking, he walks with a crutch, as a consequence of a polytraumatism after a precipitation in the context of a psychotic episode 14 years ago. The patient was found unconscious at home by his mother, unresponsive to stimuli and unable to say for how long he had been in this state. Self-intoxication with an undetermined amount of tramadol, benzodiazepines, alcohol and cocaine. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for 6 days. Complications included rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and pneumonic process. Normal cranial CAT scan. Stabilisation and transfer to the Internal Medicine ward, one week of admission, somatic overcoming of the episode. Transfer to the Psychiatry Department, voluntary admission. During the first five days of admission to the Psychiatry Unit, the patient remained psychopathologically stable. No psychotic decompensation, critical of the episode which he defines as a ""high"" and of which he states that he cannot remember the specific conditions but he does remember a previous discussion with his mother. Adapted to the rhythms of the unit, participates in occupational therapy activities. Euthymic, within the previous defectuality, concrete plans for the future, outings with the family with adequate response, possibility of discharge and follow-up at his Mental Health Centre. However, after these first asymptomatic days, the patient began to progressively present episodes of temporo-spatial disorientation accompanied by marked bradypsychia, ataxia (from crutch to walker) and generalised motor slowing. Mnesic failures accompanied by an effort to remember, aphasia and apraxia. However, the patient is calm and placid. No anxiety, sustained sleep. No changes in previous psychiatric treatment. Despite the family's insistence on pointing to ""a psychotic break"" (...) the picture is framed within a cognitive deterioration of cortical characteristics with marked impairment of the attentional system, executive function, memory and linguistic function. The EEG showed marked lenification and diffuse attenuation of the background rhythm. After assessment by Internal Medicine and Neurology, she was transferred to the Neurology Department. The initial cranial MRI showed a supratentorial diffuse leukodystrophy pattern, predominantly fronto-parietal, hyperintense in T2 and with a discrete component of restriction in the diffusion sequences. (MRI-T2, image 1; MRI-T2-FLAIR, image 2).  Ten days later, in comparison with the previous MRI, greater signal alteration was observed in the diffusion sequences with progression of the picture in T2 and T2-FLAIR at bilateral parieto-occipital level and regression in T2-FLAIR in frontal and temporal poles. During the twenty days of admission to the Neurology Department, no infectious symptoms or analytical alterations were observed and serology and antibody tests were normal. It was concluded that the clinical and neuroimaging alterations were compatible with late hypoxic encephalopathy, leaving the possibility of previous leukodystrophic lesions in the white matter in doubt. However, there was no family history of interest and there was no previous history suggesting the presence of leukodystrophy. During his stay in Neurology, the patient slowly improved spontaneously, maintaining the previous psychiatric treatment. On admission he was only able to walk with a walker and needed to be guided. On discharge he is able to move around with walking sticks without difficulty, he is able to throw coins into the coffee machine, his bradypsychia and memory have improved significantly, but he still has moments of disorientation. He attends the Rehabilitation Service on a daily basis.   "
"A 35-year-old woman, with no previous history of interest, presented with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and constitutional syndrome, which appeared a few weeks after her first birth; the previous pregnancy had passed without complications. She was studied in the Digestive System Section and was diagnosed with CD as she met the diagnostic criteria: 1) high titre of anti-transglutaminase antibodies; and 2) intestinal biopsy with villous atrophy in the duodenum and crypt hyperplasia. Shortly after the aforementioned clinical manifestations, she presented with polyarthralgia of medium-sized joints, predominantly in the carpus and tarsus, together with paraesthesia and skin lesions with pruritic micropapules. She was referred to the nephrology department for detecting proteinuria of +++. Physical examination: blood pressure 104/76 mmHg, BMI 27, minimal oedema in the lower limbs and papules on the elbows and arms. Blood tests: normal haemogram and coagulation, creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, total cholesterol 238 mg/dl, triglycerides 104 mg/dl, total protein 6.5 g/dl and albumin 3.6 g/dl. In the immunological study: ANA, anti-DNA, ANCAS, C3, C4, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and cryoglobulins were negative or normal. Serology against HBV, HCV and HIV negative. Anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies positive to titre 800 U/ml (normal <7 U/ml). Urine: protein 4.4 g/day and sediment with 5 red blood cells per field. Renal ultrasound was normal. Given the persistence of nephrotic proteinuria for several weeks, a percutaneous renal biopsy was performed, the result of which was stage 2 NM, without vascular or interstitial lesions. He received treatment with a gluten-free diet and other conservative measures with statin, aspirin at antiplatelet doses, enalapril and losartan, with no initial response. However, after 12 months of follow-up, simultaneous negativation of anti-transglutaminase antibodies and complete remission of proteinuria was observed, as shown in figure 1. During this time, there were no other signs of systemic disease, except for an increase in TSH levels of 6.6 µU/ml, with T4l of 1.1 ng/dl and negative anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal antibodies.

"60-year-old male patient with Alport syndrome, microhaematuria and proteinuria of 4 g/day, creatinine 2 mg/dl, urea 123 mg/dl, moderate hearing loss, arterial hypertension treated with enalapril 20 mg, obesity with BMI = 36.26 (P 120 kg, h 1.81 m), altered fasting blood glucose (less than 126 mg/dl), normal glycosylated Hb, dyslipidaemia and hyperuricaemia under treatment. Ex-smoker of one pack a day. Normothyroid. Renal biopsy (performed in 1995): MO (12 glomeruli) focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis evolving to sclerosing glomerulopathy, IF with mild intensity Ig M in mesangium and IgA and M in tubular cylinders. ME 2 glomeruli. Capillary MB with irregular thickening and focal unfolding of the lamina densa. Podocytes with total fusion of pedicels. In one sector, effacement of the glomerular structure with deposition of abundant amorphous material, electron dense. The alterations of the lamina densa are compatible with Alport's disease, the rest of the findings with focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis. Renal ultrasound: RD 95.6 x 52 x 53, RI 99 x 51 x 52. Renal Doppler without alterations. A low-protein, low-calorie diet was indicated and losartan was added to the treatment at a dose of 75 mg/day (maximum tolerated by the patient). A very slight reduction in proteinuria to 3.6 g/day was observed. Gastric by-pass surgery was performed, and the patient's overall weight decreased by 35 kg, reaching a BMI of 25.6. Nephrological control: creatinine 1.56 mg/dl, proteinuria 0.3 g/day, urea 65 mg/dl and normotension with enalapril 5 mg/d; minimum dose of lipid-lowering agents, normouricemia and normoglycaemia were maintained. Three years after surgery, the patient's good evolution is related to compliance with treatment (diet), aerobic exercise and clinical-psychological support.  L.

"56-year-old woman, diagnosed with pSS 13 years previously. She presented with dry syndrome, asthenia and frequent episodes of polyarthritis. During this time, she followed prolonged treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids. In addition, in recent months, methotrexate had been associated with little improvement in symptoms. Three months after starting dental treatment with dental implants, he was admitted with facial oedema, febrile syndrome and decreased diuresis. Physical examination revealed deterioration in general condition, blood pressure (BP) of 160/90 mmHg, fever and submandibular oedema with evidence of active infection in the lower dental arch. There was no distal oedema or skin lesions. Laboratory tests showed Hb 9.2 g/dl, creatinine 2.9 mg/dl, urea 110 mg/dl, normal liver profile, lipid profile, ANCA and immunoglobulins. ANA positive, anti-DNA negative. Low C3 and C4, 46 and 1.6 mg/dl, respectively. Serology for HBV, HCV and HIV negative. Blood cultures negative. ANA, anti-Ro, anti-LA and rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies remained positive since the diagnosis of SSp. He had also occasionally presented hypocomplementemia. Urine proteinuria (2 g/l) and microhaematuria were observed. Renal ultrasound was normal. The patient developed an afternoon fever, despite antibiotherapy, and oliguria, and dialysis treatment had to be started. Suspecting acute glomerulonephritis (GN), probably postinfectious, given the history of the mandibular infectious process and hypocomplementemia, a renal biopsy was performed with the following results: The cylinder for light microscopy contained 8 glomeruli showing diffuse capillary occlusion by thrombi of PAS-positive proteinaceous material. They were accompanied, in some glomeruli, by segmental infiltration of inflammatory cells. The interstitium showed isolated foci of lymphoplasmacytic inflammation and the arteries were unchanged.  Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) showed strong positivity for IgG, IgM, kappa and lambda thrombi, but weaker for C3 and IgA. C1q and fibrinogen were negative. Ultrastructural study was performed at a later stage.  Pathological diagnosis Glomeruli with massive intracapillary thrombi of immunoglobulins suspected of cryoglobulinemic glomerulopathy associated with SS.  "
"A 58-year-old woman with a personal history of depressive syndrome and lumbar canal stenosis. Diagnosed with B27-positive ankylosing spondylitis in 2005 and on treatment with adalimumab since 2008. Before starting treatment, a positive tuberculin skin test required isoniazid prophylaxis for nine months. His regular medications included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors. At a routine rheumatology check-up, a significant deterioration of her renal function was noted and she was requested to undergo a nephrology assessment. The patient was asymptomatic. On initial physical examination, there was no oedema, no palpable laterocervical or retroauricular lymphadenopathy and cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. In view of the analytical findings, a renal ultrasound was performed, showing kidneys measuring 10 and 12 cm, respectively, with good corticomedullary differentiation. There was no evidence of renal lithiasis or pyelocaliceal dilatation. The hypodense lesions in the spleen suggested possible lymphomatous involvement, at which point the patient was admitted for further studies.  The thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules (predominantly in the upper lobes with a peribronchovascular pattern) and mediastinal adenopathies. No splenic lesions were observed. A cervical adenopathy was biopsied, showing granulomatous epithelioid inflammation with extensive caseous necrosis. Ziehl-Nielsen staining showed few bacilli.  In view of these findings, it was decided to perform fibrobronchoscopy, in which no macroscopic lesions were observed in the airway. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed a moderate number of lymphocytes, bronchial lavage was negative and a transbronchial fine needle aspiration of a mediastinal adenopathy identified the existence of granulomas. Ziehl's staining was initially reported as negative, with a second observation revealing a single acid-fast bacillus. Following fibrobronchoscopy, an interferon gamma release assay for tuberculosis (quantiFERON) was performed, which was positive. Based on these tests, it was decided to start anti-tuberculosis treatment. As part of the nephrological work-up, antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), anti-DNA and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies were negative. Viral serology was negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses. Complement was normal. Urine analysis initially showed a microalbuminuria/creatininuria index of 261.9 mg/g and proteinuria/creatininuria 1.1 without nephrotic syndrome. The only notable finding in the proteinogram was a monoclonal IgM peak, with a serum concentration of 305 mg/dl and a negative urine light chain concentration. During her evolution on the ward, the patient presented sustained arterial hypertension with no evidence of water overload or other symptoms of note. Given the clinical findings (severe renal failure), radiological findings (kidneys of normal size and echostructure) and analytical findings (anaemia, proteinuria and microhaematuria), a renal biopsy was performed in which interstitial inflammation was detected at the expense of lymphocytes, accompanied by histiocytes that formed granulomas at several points. Multinucleated Langhans-type giant cells were present in one of them. The glomeruli were normal. In the tubules, the lumen was occupied with granular material and flattening of the epithelium. No microorganisms were observed in PAS and Ziehl-Nielsen staining.  After the renal biopsy, the patient was discharged on treatment with prednisone at a dose of 40 mg/day, erythropoietin and complete antituberculosis treatment (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide). The patient progressed towards slow but progressive improvement of renal function. She persisted with anaemia and high erythropoietin requirements, hypertension treated with two drugs and hyperuricaemia resolved with allopurinol.   "
"A 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, generalised osteoarthritis, NYHA stage II congestive heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation. She was being treated with metformin (850 mg/8 hours), glipizide (5 mg/day), lercanidipine (10 mg/day), lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide (20/12.5 mg/day), acenocoumarol and occasionally ibuprofen. Two days before admission due to increased bone pain, she received ibuprofen (600 mg/8 hours), and subsequently began to show general deterioration, vomiting and decreased level of consciousness. In the emergency department she was hypotensive and poorly prefused in coma (Glasgow 6/15) and blood tests showed plasma creatinine of 1.79 mg/dl, glycaemia of 215 mg/dl and prothrombin time of 7%. Arterial blood gases had a pH of 7.03 with bicarbonate of 10 mEq/l and plasma lactic acid of 14 mmol/l. Chest X-ray revealed a left base infiltrate.  She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and underwent orotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation and administration of vasoactive drugs and antibiotics. A lumbar puncture was indicated, the result of which was compatible with pneumococcal meningitis. Haemodialysis with a bicarbonate bath was performed, and the patient's blood tests subsequently improved, with plasma creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dl and serum bicarbonate of 22 mEq/l. However, the patient remained in coma, with EEG with low voltage waves, and died 72 hours after admission.  "
"76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and depressive syndrome. She was being treated with metformin 850 mg/8 hours, escitalopram 20 mg/24h, mirtazapine 30 mg/24h and simvastatin 40 mg/24h. In a blood test carried out six months earlier he had a Cr of 0.81 mg/dl. Two weeks before admission, he started treatment with ibuprofen (600 mg/8 hours) for low back pain. A week earlier she had experienced nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, for which she went to the emergency department. On examination she had dry skin and mucous membranes and her blood tests showed plasma Cr was 9 mg/dl, glucose 189 mg/dl, urea 196 mg/dl, haemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, sodium 125 mEq/l, potassium 8.6 mEq/l and lactic acid 6.3 mmol/l. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.23 and bicarbonate of 15 mEq/l. An abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral ureterohydronephrosis due to bladder neoplasia. Given the patient's haemodynamic instability, haemodialysis was performed for two hours, with a subsequent Cr of 5.9 mg/dl, potassium of 6.1 mEq/l, pH of 7.39 and bicarbonate of 22 mEq/l. Subsequently, bilateral nephrostomy was performed with improvement of the clinical picture and normalisation of the analytical figures with Cr of 1.1 mg/dl, pH of 7.31 and bicarbonate of 23 mEq/l.  "
"A 47-year-old man with long-standing type 2 diabetes on treatment with metformin (850 mg/8 h) and glimepiride (4 mg/day), an active smoker and regular drinker. He had had several episodes of acute non-lithiasic pancreatitis. A week before admission, he had a syncopal episode while working in the fields. Subsequently, he presented intense asthenia, hypoorexia and general malaise with orthostatism. He attended the health centre with a blood pressure of 70/35 mmHg and capillary glycaemia of 20 mg/dl, for which glucagon was administered i.v. In the emergency department, hypotension persisted, with signs of extracellular volume depletion and tachypnoea. Blood tests showed plasma Cr 10.3 mg/dl, glycaemia 287 mg/dl and lactic acid 20 mmol/l. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 6.87 with bicarbonate of 2.2 mEq/l. Orotracheal intubation was performed and he was admitted to the ICU with assisted ventilation and inotropic administration. Subsequently, haemodialysis was performed for four hours followed by continuous venovenous haemofiltration with analytical improvement. At discharge he had a Cr of 1.20 mg/dl, pH of 7.46 and bicarbonate of 24.6 mEq/l.  "
"We present the case of a 48-year-old woman with chronic renal failure secondary to tubulointerstitial nephropathy. The patient had received long-term HD replacement therapy and had undergone two renal transplants with transplantectomies: the first was due to acute humoral rejection and the second due to acute humoral and vascular rejection. She resumed haemodialysis treatment in March 2005. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) values were intermittently high. Previously, the patient had been treated with calcitriol for short periods of time, as the administration caused hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. In January 2006, she developed severe SHPTH (with higher iPTH levels than in previous months). Parathyroid ultrasound revealed a hyperechogenic pseudonodular image in the posteromedial area of the left thyroid lobe, which was compatible with hypertrophy of the parathyroid gland. A radiological series showed signs of hyperparathyroidism in the bones of both hands and wrists and CV in the radial and interdigital arteries. Mammography showed multiple linear VC in both breasts.  The patient was treated with calcium carbonate alone. Subsequently, oral calcitriol and sevelamer (800 mg with main meals), a phosphate (P)-chelating agent, were added to the regimen and the dose of calcium carbonate was reduced. Figure 5 shows serum Ca, P and iPTH levels. Hyperphosphataemia was brought under control after two months of treatment, and the Ca-P product level was adequate, but iPTH levels increased to 734 pg/ml, so treatment was changed. Oral calcitriol was replaced by oral cinacalcet 30 mg once daily and intravenous alfacalcidol (2 µg) immediately after haemodialysis. The doses of calcium carbonate and sevelamer were not changed.  Two months later, the calcimimetic dose was reduced due to hypocalcaemia levels (7.6 mg/dl). Treatment with intravenous vitamin D and calcium carbonate was maintained, and the calcium in the dialysate was changed from 2.5 to 3 mEq/l. Over the next six months, the levels of all parameters remained within the range recommended by the KDOQI guidelines. In November 2006, excessive suppression of iPTH (138 pg/ml) and potential hypercalcaemia (9.4 mg/dl) were observed and treatment with calcium carbonate and alfacalcidol was discontinued. In January 2007, treatment was continued with sevelamer (800 mg with main meals) and a minimal weekly dose of calcimimetic (30 mg cinacalcet on Mondays and Fridays), resulting in good control of mineral metabolism. During this period, it could be observed that in the radiological series the calcifications of the interdigital artery had disappeared and the bone had a more structured appearance. Mammography also showed regression of the VCs. The initial linear calcifications were replaced by irregular calcifications.   "
"A 39-year-old man with no toxic habits, allergic to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and diclofenac. He initially consulted for soft tissue swelling associated with palpable purpura in both lower limbs in April 2001. Immunological tests revealed positive cryoglobulinaemia with a cryocrit of 9.2% (IgM kappa monoclonal IgM and IgG component). Serologies for hepatotropic viruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative, as were antiphospholipid antibodies. Physical examination revealed palpable purpura in the lower extremities; the rest of the examination was unremarkable. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no lymphadenopathy or visceromegaly. With the suggestion of cutaneous vasculitis, treatment was started with prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day, with an initial favourable evolution and disappearance of the lesions. One year after the first consultation, the patient reported paresthesia in the lower limbs, again associated with petechiae in the same location, this time presenting with nephritic syndrome. Laboratory tests showed hypocomplementemia, a cryocrit of 17% and a proteinogram with a faint abnormal band in the gamma zone. Serum immunoelectrophoresis: restricted mobility component IgM kappa (there was no evidence of monoclonality in the urine). Renal function showed creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, sediment with red blood cells +++ and proteinuria 2.8 g/day. Renal biopsy confirmed the presence of glomerulonephritis with mesangiocapillary pattern. Azathioprine was added to the treatment, with maintenance of renal function and proteinuria of around 1g.  After six years of follow-up, an analytical control revealed a peripheral blood immunophenotype compatible with LLP. This finding was later corroborated with a bone marrow aspirate in which bone marrow infiltration by chronic small B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome was observed, compatible with quiescent LLP, so at that time he did not require chemotherapy treatment. One year later, the patient presented persistent proteinuria of 4.7 g/24 h, so it was decided to perform a new renal biopsy that confirmed the presence of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis and also showed lymphocytic infiltration compatible with low-grade B lymphoma. Given the renal involvement by the lymphoma, it was decided to start treatment with rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 subcutaneous (s.c.) x 4 and plasma exchange.  Two years after anti-CD20 treatment, the patient has lymphoproliferative syndrome in remission and renal involvement is maintained in the form of residual proteinuria (4 g/day) with preserved renal function (Cr 0.8 mg/dl, GFR: 100 ml/min) under treatment with double blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.   "
"A 67-year-old woman with multiple risk factors: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, dysglycosis, obesity, acute coronary syndrome, etc. She had a single left kidney with stenosis due to stage 3 chronic kidney disease (K/DOQUI Guidelines) secondary to ischaemic nephropathy with preserved diuresis. Angiographically, he presented critical stenosis of the left renal artery and uncontrolled hypertension despite drug treatment with quintuple therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics and alpha-blockers). Previous tests showed a creatinine level of 1.9-2.4 mg % and a rebellious blood pressure (BP). Her anaesthetic risk is moderate, and she underwent scheduled surgery to place a stent in the left renal artery under locoregional anaesthesia with continuous blood pressure monitoring. During surgery she is haemodynamically stable, with maintained diuresis. During the postoperative period, he began with sudden intense pain in the left renal fossa accompanied by hypotension, vegetative symptoms and sudden oligoanuria. Subsequently, he began with chest pain, radiating to the back, with no changes in the electrocardiogram or elevation of cardiac markers. However, treatment for ischaemic heart disease was started. Given the suspicion of stent thrombosis, an arteriography was performed via the left femoral artery confirming renal artery thrombosis (thrombolysis was attempted without success) and migration of the stent, which was unsuccessfully repositioned. During the procedure he was haemodynamically unstable and required vasoactive drugs and blood transfusion; in anuria, with increased urea and creatinine levels, so a dialysis catheter was implanted. He required high doses of vasoactive drugs to maintain BP, haemodiafiltration due to anuria with rising urea and creatinine levels and echocardiography which ruled out cardiogenic component. He presented coagulation alterations with no evidence of active bleeding and rapid clinical deterioration with respiratory failure dependent on mechanical ventilation. Abdominal computed axial tomography showed the presence of a retroperitoneal haematoma, and urgent laparotomy was performed. The situation was complicated by the presence of distributive shock refractory to vasoactive drugs, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and anuric renal failure, and led to a situation of multi-organ failure secondary to complications of vascular surgery on renal ischaemia in a single patient who was finally exhaled, the immediate cause of which was shock refractory to treatment.   "
"A 33-year-old man consulted the nephrology department at the end of 2006 due to an increase in serum creatinine (Crs) to 1.4 mg/dl. He had no history or clinical manifestations of urological or renal disease. Five years earlier, his Crs was 0.9 mg/dl. At the age of 18 he was diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia and gastro-oesophageal reflux. In the last 4 years he reported dysphagia and postprandial heaviness, without other gastrointestinal manifestations; also lumbar pain with mechanical characteristics. Absence of febrile episodes, joint inflammation, skin lesions, serositis, or other organs or systems. Family history of ankylopoietic spondylitis in several males of his paternal branch; a paternal uncle was also diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease secondary to nephropathy due to analgesic abuse. Physical examination normal, blood pressure: 130/79 mmHg, body mass index: 21 kg/m2. Complementary examinations Blood tests: Crs: 1.47 mg/dl; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by MDRD-4: 59 ml/min/1.73 m2; urea: 33 mg/dl; ions, liver enzymes and lipids: normal. Total proteins, proteinogram, immunoglobulins and complement: normal. Rheumatoid factor negative. C-reactive protein (CRP): 13 mg/l (normal value [NRV] < 10 mg/l). Antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and histocompatibility antigen-B27 were negative. Iron parameters: sideremia: 25 µg/dl (VN: 40-60); ferritin: 38 ng/ml (VN: 20-300), transferrin saturation index: 12%. Vitamin B12: 181 pg/ml (VN: 208-930) and folic acid: 3.3 ng/ml (VN: 7.2-15). Urinalysis: proteinuria: 200 mg/24 h; albuminuria: 47 mg/24 h, without monoclonal free light chains. Urine sediment normal. Chest and spine X-rays without significant alterations. Abdominal, renal and urinary tract ultrasound: normal. The rheumatology department ruled out ankylopoietic spondylitis. Laboratory tests at 2 months showed: Crs: 1.64 mg/dl; eGFR (MDRD-4): 52 ml/min/1.73 m2; proteinuria: 316 mg/24 h; albuminuria: 163 mg/24 h. And 4 months later: Crs: 1.77 mg/dl; eGFR (MDRD-4): 47 ml/min/1.73 m2; proteinuria: 640 mg/24 h. Deficiencies of iron and vitamins B12 and folic acid were partially corrected with oral supplements. Given the persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms (dysphagia, dyspepsia) and suspicion of intestinal malabsorption (iron and vitamin deficiencies), we considered an endoscopic study of the gastrointestinal tract with biopsies. The main alterations were found in the mucosa of the terminal ileum: ulcerated villous architecture, lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory reaction in the lamina propria, with neutrophil infiltration (abscesses in crypts) and epithelioid histiocyte granulomas; compatible with CD. In the mucosa of the rectum, in the walls of the blood vessels of the lamina propria, a deposit of material with staining characteristics (congo red and immunohistochemistry) typical of AA amyloidosis was found, without inflammatory signs. A percutaneous renal biopsy was also performed in view of the unfavourable progression of renal parameters (renal function and proteinuria), which showed: 7 glomeruli, 3 with practically global sclerosis, and the remaining with scant deposits of eosinophilic material in the hilum of the glomerular ring; occasional areas of interstitial fibrosis, and deposit of eosinophilic material in the walls of the blood vessels more extensive and intense than the glomerular ones. The deposits were cone red positive with green birefringence to polarised light and immunohistochemistry determined the presence of amyloid A protein. This patient did not have, nor has he had in the subsequent evolution, any symptoms or clinical signs suggestive of any other type of inflammatory, infectious or tumour disease, nor familial Mediterranean fever. With the diagnosis of CD and secondary AA amyloidosis, etiological treatment of CD was decided based on infliximab 5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 months, azathioprine 1-1.5 mg/kg/day (only the first year, suspended due to leukopenia) and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker. Renal parameters improved, as well as inflammatory markers (CRP: 5 mg/l, and serum amyloid A protein < 5 mg/l), and are maintained after 4 years of follow-up. There have been no major CD complications or medication side effects.   "
"53-year-old male, retired, living in a rural area. He was diagnosed 10 years ago with inflammatory bowel disease, which is controlled only with high doses of steroids. Two years earlier he had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for sepsis of intestinal origin with multi-organ failure; since then he has been on periodic haemodialysis due to lack of functional recovery. Renal biopsy showed tubulointerstitial nephropathy. Since one month before admission, she had presented erythematous skin lesions, on indurated, pruritic and painful areas on the dorsum of the right foot and inner thighs, with poor response to antibiotic treatment (started empirically due to suspicion of cellulitis), which progressively evolved towards desquamation and subsequent ulceration. A skin biopsy was performed and reported as cryptococcosis. Direct examination with India ink and Gram stain revealed abundant large, spherical yeasts with marked twinning and encapsulation. Culture showed a yeast-like fungus, urease positive, compatible with cryptococcus neoformans, variety neoformans. Serum cryptolatex positive 1/2048. Pulmonary and neurological involvement was ruled out by computerised axial tomography and lumbar puncture.  We started treatment with voriconazole 200 mg/12 hours, and after 10 days there was a marked alteration in liver tests (total bilirubin: 9.59 mg/dl; direct bilirubin: 9.41 mg/dl; glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [GOT] 176 U/l; glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [GPT]: 226 U/l), which made it necessary to replace it with amphotericin B at a dose of 100 mg/day. In addition to this, the prednisone dose was reduced. Thus, after 2 weeks he presented a marked improvement of the lesions with almost complete disappearance of the ulcerations and normalisation of the liver tests.   "
"A 76-year-old man with stage 4 CKD secondary to hepatorenal polycystic kidney disease with a history of long-standing arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperuricaemia, dyslipidaemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Given the situation of advanced CKD and after explaining the different dialysis techniques, a straight, non-self-positioning 1 cuff peritoneal catheter was inserted by open surgery without immediate incidents and with good functioning during the training period. One month after placement of the catheter, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was started at home with a pattern of 3 exchanges of 2 litres of dextrose 1.5%, initially with neutral or negative balances of 200-300 ml. Four days after starting home treatment, he came to the peritoneal dialysis unit reporting genital oedema, with no other associated symptoms. After performing a testicular ultrasound scan, pathology at this level was ruled out. In view of the suspicion of leakage, a computerised axial tomography (CAT)-peritoneography was performed, after the administration (via catheter) of 100 ml of hypoosmolar iodised contrast (Optiray® 300 mg/ml), confirming the passage of peritoneal contrast material through the spermatic cord to the scrotum due to the presence of a permeable, although not dilated, peritoneovaginal process. There was also an ipsilateral left indirect inguinal hernia with a sac up to 58 mm in diameter. In view of these findings, it was decided to perform peritoneal rest and surgery was indicated to correct the inguinal hernia and close the peritoneovaginal duct. With these measures, and after restarting peritoneal dialysis with low volumes, one month after the reintervention, no new leak was observed.   "
"Female patient, 37 years old, black, with a history of sickle cell anaemia and end-stage chronic renal failure, on haemodialysis for 6 years. She had previously presented several episodes of sickle cell crises with the need for multiple transfusions. In November 2010 she underwent renal transplantation from a deceased donor, sharing a RD and an A, with a cold ischaemia time of 15 hours. Induction with alemtuzumab and methylprednisolone boluses was performed. During the transoperative period, the patient was hypotensive, requiring dopamine. Perfusion of the renal graft was slow, with recovery during surgery. Postoperatively, the patient became anuric, with elevated azooses and metabolic acidosis; the peripheral blood smear reported hypochromia, anisocytosis, microcytosis and dianocytosis, high density lipoproteins 677, leukocytes 17,800, neutrophils 90 %, lymphocytes 8 %, haemoglobin 7.1, haematocrit 21 %, platelets 179,000, corrected reticulocytes 5.2 %. Graft Doppler reported good vascular perfusion, but high resistance indices. A vaso-occlusive graft crisis was suspected and management with transfusions, hydroxyurea and haemodialysis was initiated. On the fifth day, a biopsy of the renal graft was performed; the most important findings were areas of infarction in peritubular capillaries with the presence of neutrophils and erythrocyte trapping, some of which were sickle-shaped, and positive C4d in 100% of the peritubular capillaries. With these findings, a diagnosis of acute humoral rejection and sickle cell crisis of the graft was made; treatment was carried out with methylprednisolone pulses, plasmapheresis, tacrolimus, mycophenolate and exchange transfusion, the latter as management of the sickle cell crisis. Ten days after transplantation, renal function improved and renal replacement therapy was discontinued. The last control creatinine, four months later, was 1.3 mg/dl.   "
"We present the case of a 20-year-old male who consulted for hypertensive crises of one year's duration, accompanied by profuse sweating, generalised flushing, headache and, occasionally, lumbar pain. Blood pressure levels reached 230/110 mmHg, often triggered by physical exertion. Physical examination revealed malar and palmar erythema, which disappeared with acupressure. Laboratory tests showed elevated 24-hour urinary catecholamines and metanephrines: noradrenaline excretion 7515.77 nmol/24 h (< 504), dopamine 4298.84 nmol/24 h (< 3237) and normetanephrines 39676 nmol/24 h (< 2424). An abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing a retroperitoneal mass of about 8 cm, with heterogeneous echogenicity and marked vascularisation. In view of this finding, abdominal-pelvic computed axial tomography (CT) was performed, confirming the existence of a retroperitoneal mass measuring 8 x 4 cm above the aortic bifurcation, which infiltrated the inferior vena cava and bordered the aorta at 180o, encompassing the inferior mesenteric artery. Given the CT findings, cavography was performed to assess resectability, and an infrarenal intracaval repletion defect of 2 cm in diameter was observed.  Given the suspicion of paraganglioma of the organ of Zuckerkandl, beta and alpha-adrenergic blockade was performed, followed by surgical intervention with en bloc resection of the tumour; the anterior aspect of the cava was partially sectioned to remove the intracaval tumour. The postoperative period passed without complications, the clinical symptoms disappeared and the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and metanephrines normalised. The anatomopathological diagnosis confirmed the suspicion of a well-demarcated capsulated paraganglioma, with a low proliferative index (ki 67: 5-7 %). He was referred to Medical Oncology, where a 123I-MIBG scan was requested, which showed no signs of residual or distant disease. In the absence of data justifying adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, periodic follow-up was decided.   "
"A 56-year-old man, with a personal history of alcoholic hepatitis, who in 1995 was admitted to the hospital to be studied for nephrotic syndrome, microhaematuria and renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.5 mg/dl). Physical examination revealed oedema, hepatomegaly and purpuric lesions on the lower limbs. The study showed positive serology for HCV, the rest of the serologies negative and positive cryoglobulins. A renal biopsy showed renal parenchyma with seven glomeruli with diffuse involvement, increased cellularity and lobular mesangial matrix, basement membranes with double-contour images, irregular thickening of the capillary walls and interstitial fibrosis. Direct immunofluorescence showed glomerular parietal granular C3 deposits and electron microscopy showed subendothelial deposits, swollen endothelia and mesangial enlargement. The patient was diagnosed with HCV-associated MPGN with positive cryoglobulins.  The patient was referred to the gastrointestinal clinic for joint evaluation of HCV treatment. A liver biopsy was performed which revealed liver cirrhosis (P-3, L-2, F-3). With these results, treatment with interferon alpha was started, initially without achieving a sustained viral response, and subsequently in its pegylated form for 48 weeks, achieving a negative viral load. Four months after the end of treatment, he presented an episode of acute pericarditis with HCV in the pericardial fluid coinciding with a new increase in viral load. The patient had had poor clinical tolerance to both previous treatments and it was decided not to start new therapies. Other complications included inflammatory arthritis of large joints. From the renal point of view, antiproteinuric treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade was started, despite which the patient developed progressive renal failure and finally started haemodialysis in 2007. In November 2009, he received his first deceased donor kidney transplant due to a spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage. The donor had HLA typing: DR1, DRX, B14, B35, A11, A30 and a history of enolism, with creatinine at the time of extraction of 1 mg/dl and negative proteinuria. Immunosuppression with corticosteroids, mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus was performed. Renal evolution was excellent and renal function was immediate. Thirteen months after transplantation, the patient developed non-nephrotic proteinuria and microhaematuria with haematic casts, but maintained normal renal function. An autoimmunity study, donor-specific antibodies, as well as antigenemia for cytomegalovirus and serum PCR (polymerase enzyme chain reaction) for BK virus were negative, and renal Doppler ultrasound was normal. Given the suspicion of recurrence of the underlying disease, it was decided to perform a renal biopsy. Light microscopy showed renal parenchyma with ten glomeruli with marked mesangial enlargement, mild fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Immunofluorescence showed granular mesangial deposits of IgA and C3, and electron microscopy showed mesangial enlargement of cells and matrix with abundant homogeneous electrodense deposits. Immunohistochemistry for C4d was negative. A diagnosis of de novo IgA mesangial GN in the graft was made, and the dose of corticosteroids and mycophenolic acid was increased without clinical-biochemical improvement. After starting antiproteinuric treatment, with blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by means of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARA II) and the subsequent association of spironolactone, proteinuria became negative, although with a slight deterioration of renal function, currently stabilised.

"A 44-year-old woman with a history of ex-smoking, hypertension, type 2 DM, morbid obesity (BMI 59.19 kg/m2), cholecystectomy, appendectomy, umbilical herniorrhaphy and caesarean section. She was referred to General Surgery for bariatric surgery using the Larrad technique. She attended the emergency department two months after the operation, reporting repeated postprandial vomiting since discharge and a syncopal episode. Physical examination revealed poor general condition, signs of hydrosaline depletion, BP 66/48 and PVC 4 cc H2O. Blood tests: urea 284 mg/dl, Cr 6.98 mg/dl, Na 119 mmol/l, K 2.4 mmol/l, Cl 65 mmol/l, CRP 4.8 mg/dl, lactate 4.7 mmol/l, osmolarity 333 mOsm/kg; haemogram: Hb 14.2 g/dl, HV 42%; leucocytes 19000/ul; platelets 251000/ul; venous blood gases: pH 7.49, bicarbonate 25.9 mmol/l, pCO2 34 mmHg; urine renal function: EF Na 0.11%, urea 276 mg/dl, Cr 274.8 mg/dl, Na 5 mmol/l, K 15.4 mmol/l. The patient was admitted to the nephrology department with a diagnosis of pre-renal ARF secondary to volume depletion, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia. Hydrosaline replacement and progressive electrolyte correction was started with improvement in renal function until normalisation. During her admission, the patient presented respiratory failure and septic shock secondary to respiratory infection. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and died after two months of hospitalisation.   "
"We present the case of a 64-year-old man with no history of interest, who consulted for a 17 kg weight loss, asthenia, anorexia and anaemia. Colonoscopy showed non-specific inflammatory changes of the colonic mucosa and gastroscopy showed gastric neoplasia and antral gastropathy, with biopsies taken. Histology of the gastric biopsy confirmed a neoplastic proliferation with a solid pattern suggestive of GIST, and immunohistochemistry was positive for CD117. Subsequently, he started with oedema in the lower limbs and diarrhoea. Laboratory tests showed: haemoglobin 8.7 g/dl, haematocrit 28%, mean corpuscular volume 75, serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dl; total protein 5.9 g/dl; albumin 1.36 g/dl; cholesterol 96 mg/dl; transferrin saturation index 13%. Proteinuria 5.1 g/day and sediment with 4-6 red blood cells/field. Given the patient's poor condition, renal biopsy was not performed and it was assumed that the amyloidosis previously observed in the gastrointestinal biopsies was responsible for the nephrotic syndrome and diarrhoea. Cardiac amyloidosis was ruled out by echocardiogram. Treatment was started with a selective cKit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib (Glivec®), 100 mg daily. 15 months after diagnosis, surgical excision was decided after a decrease in tumour mass was observed on positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Pathological anatomy confirmed the involvement of the excised stomach and splenic flexure of the colon. As such, it was classified as a high-risk GIST (> 5 cm in size, > 5 mitoses per high magnification field)2. Renal function continued to deteriorate, so he finally entered a regular haemodialysis programme, one year and seven months after the GIST was found, with the diagnosis of chronic renal failure secondary to AA amyloidosis.   "
"A 46 year old patient with no past history of interest came to the emergency department with pain in the left teste radiating to the ipsilateral flank, without fever or accompanying micturition syndrome. Physical examination was unremarkable, except for arterial hypertension. Renal and testicular-prostatic ultrasound with no findings. Rapidly progressive deterioration of renal function (creatinine 9.79 mg/dl, 4.85 g/24 proteinuria without active sediment) and progressive anaemia (Hb 8.1 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume 88 fl, mean corpuscular haemoglobin 31.1, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration 35.4). Immunological study (antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies, anti-GBM, anti-streptolysin, rheumatoid factor, C3-4), viral serology and tumour markers were normal. Proteinogram-immunofixation with immunoglobulin (Ig)A-kappa monoclonal band. IgG 317, IgA 1446, IgM 15 mg/dl, free light chain (FLC, Free-Lite® nephelometry) kappa 4090 ng/ml, lambda 1. Uric acid 10.8, LDH 269, calcium 10.2, albumin 3.3, B2-microglobulin 23340. Anatomopathological diagnosis was made of kappa light chain cylinder nephropathy (CLL-K) and Durie Salmon stage IIIB IgA-kappa MM, and treatment was started with bortezomib-dexamethasone, together with renal depurative therapy with Theralite® high cut-off filter every other day.  Over the following two months, serum IgA levels decreased progressively and significantly, but not pre-dialysis FLC-K, but it was decided in a multidisciplinary clinical session to continue with the treatment established according to the haematology protocol and to rebiopsy the kidney to assess the continuation of renal depurative therapy. The rebiopsy revealed chronic tubulointerstitial lesions of mild-moderate intensity, and 6 more cycles of high cut-off dialysis were prescribed.  Three months after diagnosis, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy, bortezomib was declared ineffective and was replaced by lenalidomide adjusted to renal function. Due to economic reasons, the continuation of FLC depurative therapy was not possible (having received a total of 18 sessions), and the patient remained on renal replacement therapy with conventional high-flux dialysis. The efficacy of lenalidomide is confirmed (Task Force, SWOG and EMBT), which the patient is on three years after diagnosis, in addition to renal replacement therapy.   "
"A 48-year-old man who had been referred 9 years earlier for proteinuria. He had been treated with amlodipine, atenolol and irbesartan for 2 years. In the general study he had proteinuria 1200 mg/day, 448 red blood cells/μl in the sediment, creatinine 1.05 mg/dl and negative immunology. In the renal biopsy: 5-10 glomeruli without striking cellularity, without exudation, 2-4 glomeruli with complete sclerosis, discrete chronic lymphomonocytic infiltrates in the interstitium, without vascular involvement, without tubular atrophy; in the immunofluorescence IgM immunoglobulin deposits of focal and segmental distribution in 10 glomeruli, with + and ++ intensity in the mesangial region. He was diagnosed as focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis with the addition of ramipril 2.5-5 mg/day, observing a reduction in proteinuria to <400 mg/day. Three years ago he suffered an increase in proteinuria of 1.6 g/day, albuminuria 895 mg/day and 250 red blood cells/μl, with normoalbuminaemia and oedema. Treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide was tried, with a decrease in proteinuria after 7 months of treatment to 1.1 g/day, but with proximal muscle weakness that was interpreted as steroid myopathy. Prednisone was discontinued and changed to mycophenolate mofetil 1 g/day and amlodipine was withdrawn due to its possible influence on oedema, adding 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide due to poor blood pressure control. After 2 months, mycophenolate was discontinued because the patient reported significant fatigue which he attributed to this drug. Cyclosporin A was then started at a dose of 150 mg/day (1.9 mg/kg/day) with good initial tolerance (levels 67.8 ng/ml). After 2 months, the patient consulted for pain in the left breast accompanied by a retroareolar nodule the size of a chestnut that was tender to the touch. Cyclosporin A was discontinued, and mammography and ultrasound were performed, finding glandular enlargement with no signs of malignancy, which was interpreted as medication-related glandular hyperplasia. Eight months later tacrolimus was introduced (initial 6 mg/day with subsequent reduction to 4-5 mg/day with levels <8 ng/ml). After 2 months the patient presented with new left breast pain, so he discontinued as he presented proteinuria <250 mg/day. At the last review 5 months later, proteinuria had risen to 650 mg/day and the glandular growth had subsided, leaving him on treatment with doxazosin, atenolol, irbesartan and ramipril.   "
"Male patient, 33 years old, with a history of chronic end-stage renal failure secondary to polycystic disease. He was transplanted from a deceased donor at another institution in 2007. He received immunosuppressive treatment with prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. In March 2012 he underwent a renal biopsy that reported acute cellular rejection Banff IA. He received treatment with methylprednisolone 1500 mg, prednisone 50 mg per day, mycophenolate 3000 mg per day and tacrolimus XL 7 mg per day. One month later, the patient presented with fever, frontal and retro-ocular headache, with decreased sensitivity in the right hemiface. He was evaluated and diagnosed with acute sinusitis and was started on treatment with amoxicillin. The patient did not improve and began to present ocular proptosis, oedema of the right upper jaw, greenish rhinorrhoea, diplopia, epiphora, ulcer in the palate, convulsions and azotemia. For this reason he was referred to our institution. On admission he was feverish, with oedema in the right hemicara, extensive ulcer on the hard palate, ocular proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, loss of vision in the right eye and altered renal function. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed involvement of the paranasal sinuses, right orbit, frontal lobe, cavernous sinuses, right basal ganglia and ipsilateral area of the thalamus. With these findings, a diagnosis of MROC was made, so liposomal amphotericin B was started, immunosuppression was suspended and the patient underwent radical multidisciplinary surgery, where sinusitis drainage, drainage of the right frontal brain abscess, extensive resection of the soft and bony tissues of the right hemiface, enucleation, tracheostomy and gastrostomy were performed. Cultures and pathology confirmed Mucor infection. Additionally E. cloacae, C. sedlakii, K pneumoniae BLEE (β-lactamase extended spectrum enzyme-lactamase) positive were isolated.  A magnetic resonance imaging check still shows involvement of the disease in the brain. However, given the extent and serious sequelae of more radical surgery, it was decided to continue medical management. For this reason, treatment was completed for 6 weeks after radical surgery with liposomal amphotericin B, meropenem, linezolid and posaconazole plus twice-weekly dressings. Subsequently he was discharged with posaconazole 400 mg every 12 hours, cyclosporine 50 mg every 12 hours, prednisone 5 mg daily and nutrition by gastrostomy. Six months later the patient was in good general condition, with no signs of active infection and with acceptable renal graft function (creatinine 1.5 mg/dl). He underwent successful surgical reconstruction. Six months after reconstruction the patient is in good general condition and is currently planning to complete his facial reconstruction process.   "
"A 48-year-old Caucasian man with CKD secondary to renal hypoplasia started haemodialysis in 1984. That same year he received his first kidney transplant from a living donor, his father, who remained functional until 1997, when he returned to haemodialysis due to chronic graft nephropathy and underwent transplantectomy. In 1999, he received his second cadaveric donor kidney transplant, returning to haemodialysis in November 2002 after the development of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis secondary to HCV on the renal graft. A non-A, non-B hepatitis was diagnosed in 1984 and a liver biopsy in 2000 showed chronic periportal hepatitis (P3L3F2) with positive HCV RNA (genotype 3). After the patient returned to haemodialysis to be put back on the renal transplant list, treatment with IFN-α, 3 million units three times a week, was started in March 2003. In April 2003, he began to experience pain at the level of the renal graft, haematuria and fever, for which reason the INF-α was suspended and a scheduled transplantectomy was performed, with histology showing intense parenchymal lesions of acute and chronic rejection. In August of the same year, HCV-RNA negativity was confirmed despite one month of antiviral treatment. However, in January 2004 he relapsed, so antiviral treatment was reintroduced and continued for 12 months, achieving an SVR with no new relapse. In February 2008 he received his third cadaveric donor kidney transplant. He currently has normal renal function and maintains an undetectable viral load five years after the end of treatment.   "
"A 50-year-old Caucasian woman with CKD secondary to polycystic kidney disease started haemodialysis in 1987 and received her first cadaveric donor kidney transplant in 1988. As complications of the transplant, he presented acute rejection treated with steroid shocks, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3), returning to haemodialysis in June 2009 after loss of the renal graft due to chronic nephropathy. He was diagnosed with ""non-A, non-B"" hepatitis in 1987 in connection with polytransfusion of blood products, and HCV-RNA positive (genotype 1a) was subsequently confirmed. In November 2009, five months after return to dialysis, treatment was started with pegylated IFN α2a, 135 μg weekly, and RBV 200 mg every 48 hours, with oscillating erythropoietin support throughout treatment. In February 2010, he started with fever and haematuria, so the dose of antiviral treatment was reduced and embolisation of the renal graft was performed on suspicion of acute rejection of the non-functioning graft. Treatment was resumed with IFN and RBV at the initial dose, which had to be suspended at week 40 due to the appearance of exudative erythema multiforme with no response to corticosteroid treatment. The patient had a rapid viral response with undetectable load at week 4 of treatment and subsequent SVR. In July 2011, she received her second cadaveric donor kidney transplant. She currently maintains normal renal function and negative viral load.   "
"A 68-year-old woman, whose only history of interest was iron deficiency anaemia studied by Gastroenterology since May 2013, with no history of nephrological problems. After progressive anaemia (haemoglobin 6.5g/dl), she was referred to hospital for transfusion of red blood cell concentrate, with a post-transfusion reaction and progressive deterioration of renal function, reaching maximum creatinine levels of 7.67mg/dl, urea 171mg/dl and oligoanuria. Admission to the Nephrology Department was decided, where a complete work-up was performed and haemoglobin values of up to 4.2mg/dl, LDH of 997IU/l, indirect bilirubin of 1.1mg/dl, reticulocytes 2.9%, haptoglobin of 36.40mg/dl and in the blood smear: anisopoikilocytosis with polychromasia were observed. A urine dipstick showed haematuria and pyuria. The data suggested intravascular haemolytic anaemia of autoimmune origin due to blood incompatibility. The haematology department was consulted and reported the presence of irregular antibodies with anti-Tja specificity at a titre of 1/16. These results are compatible with the absence of an antigen of high incidence in the general population, the P antigen. During admission, renal function improved. He required several sessions of haemodialysis, supportive treatment with intense serum therapy and alkalinisation, and treatment for his anaemia with erythropoietin and intravenous iron, transfusion of four red blood cell concentrates. He currently has a creatinine of 0.3mg/dl and a haemoglobin of 10.6g/dl.   "
"This is a one-month-old male, of Moroccan origin, who came to the emergency department with vomiting, refusal of food and abdominal distension of 4 days' duration. The pregnancy was controlled, with no obstetric or perinatal history of interest, and the baby was born at term with a weight appropriate for his gestational age. Examination revealed a fair general condition, with cutaneous and mucosal pallor and generalised oedema, predominantly in the lower extremities. A polyfocal grade IV/VI systolic murmur was auscultated. The abdomen was distended, with presence of superficial venous network and ascites. Laboratory examination showed normocytic normochromic anaemia, leukocytosis with normal formula, creatinine less than 0.2mg/dl and urea 10mg/dl, increased cholesterol and triglycerides, and decreased total protein and albumin, in addition to hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia. Parathyroid hormone was slightly elevated. Urine proteinuria was in the nephrotic range with a proteinuria/creatinuria ratio of 33.7.  Given the suspicion of CNS, intensive diuretic and antiproteinuric therapy, antithrombotic prophylaxis, adjuvant treatment with alpha-calcidiol, iron, calcium carbonate and levothyroxine, as well as enteral nutrition with hyperproteic and hypercaloric formula were started. He required treatment with serum albumin and erythropoietin. The cardiological study diagnosed moderate valvular pulmonary stenosis and atrial septal defect. The genetic study found Frameshift type mutations for the NPHS1 gene, Intronic Variant type for the NPHS2 gene and Missense type for the WT1 gene. At three months of age he was readmitted for seizures secondary to severe hypocalcaemia. Due to the high levels of intravenous calcium required for its control through a peripheral venous access, a third-degree burn occurred, which required the placement of a skin graft. He required intensive care on two occasions at 4 and 6 months of age due to sepsis secondary to Staphylococcus hominis and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively, which were resolved with empirical antibiotherapy and subsequently according to antibiogram. Finally, the patient died at 8 months of age due to bilateral pneumonia associated with pneumothorax with decompensation of his underlying pathology that caused refractory hypoxaemia.   "
"67-year-old woman from Bulgaria, hypertensive, diabetic, obese, dyslipidaemic and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) possibly secondary to diabetes and/or nephroangiosclerosis, on HD since January 2008. Low socioeconomic status, living with animals and poor personal hygiene. Left humerocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) was performed, with a torpid evolution, performing HD by transient CVC (multiple withdrawals and new cannulations due to catheter entry site infections [PEC]). She was admitted with fever and chills after dialysis, compatible with bacteraemia, with positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus (St.) aureus. He associated infection in PEC, so the catheter was removed, which was cultured, growing AX, together with St. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. With combined treatment for the three germs, the clinical and bacteriological infectious picture disappears.   "
"A 35-year-old man diagnosed with HLA B27-positive ankylosing spondylitis in 2011. An abdominal ultrasound showed multiple hepatic and renal cysts. Right kidney 18cm and left kidney 19cm. In the absence of a family history of cystic disease, a diagnosis of polycystic disease due to de novo mutation was made. In March 2011 she started treatment with adalimumab (Humira®) 40mg every 15 days. At that time he presented: haemoglobin (Hb) 12.4g/dl, creatinine (Cr) 2.3mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) 34ml/min/1.73m2, proteinuria of 10mg/dl. In September 2011: Cr 3.24mg/dl, eGFR MDRD 23ml/min/1.73m2, proteinuria 1.78g/24h. Treatment was discontinued in January 2012 due to the development of polyneuropathy and purpura. In February 2012 a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed 18cm right kidney (volume 2450ml) and 18cm left kidney (2250ml). In April 2012 Golimumab (Simponi®) 50mg every five weeks is started. Six doses were administered and discontinued in September 2012, when the patient reported a marked increase in abdominal diameter and umbilical hernia directly related to the administration of the drug. A final dose was administered in December 2012. In March 2013, a new MRI scan showed a right kidney of 25.4cm with a volume of 3899ml and a left kidney of 24.1cm with a volume of 2739ml and a discrete increase in much smaller amounts of liver cysts.   "
"A woman diagnosed with AHT at the age of 14, when she was first admitted to a paediatric hospital, with blood pressure (BP) of 210/120mmHg, headaches and hypokalaemia. Suspecting secondary hypertension, she underwent several tests. Renal ultrasound, echocardiogram and catheterisation of the aorta and renal arteries showed no abnormalities. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA) levels were elevated on two occasions. Urinary vanillylmandelic acid and plasma TSH, free T4 and T3 levels were normal. She was discharged from hospital on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, but did not return for follow-up. At 19 years of age, she consulted another hospital for hypertension and was eight weeks pregnant, for which she was hospitalised in intensive care. Good foetal health, BP 200/110mmHg and hypokalaemia were determined, and treatment with clonidine and alpha methyl dopa was started. Renal ultrasound showed a regular nodular formation of 45mm in diameter in the lower pole of the left kidney, ultrasonographically compatible with angiomyolipoma. PRA and AP levels were elevated. She continued on outpatient treatment with labetalol and nifedipine. At 19 weeks' gestation she was admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of missed abortion, and a curettage was performed. Four days later she requested voluntary discharge and did not return for follow-up. Two years later, while on medication with enalapril, losartan and amlodipine, she was admitted to our hospital ward with occipital headache and muscle weakness of several days' duration. BP was found to be 220/140mmHg. Initial studies showed hypokalaemia of 2mEq/l, plasma creatinine of 0.6mg/dl and plasma urea of 25mg/dl. Renal ultrasound showed a solid nodular image, corroborated by contrasted abdominal computed tomography, where a voluminous space-occupying formation was observed, solid, in the interpolar sector and lower pole of the left kidney, 65mm in diameter, hypovascularised. The Doppler of the renal arteries and the echocardiogram showed no alterations.  Given the presumptive diagnosis of HTN secondary to renal tumour, due to high renin levels, and having ruled out other secondary causes of HTN in previous studies, it was decided to perform a nephrectomy of the affected kidney, having previously controlled BP with the addition of spironolactone at a dose of 100mg/day to his usual medication. Pathological examination revealed a 5.5x4.5cm encapsulated tumour, haemorrhagic in appearance, with whitish fibrous areas. Microscopically, the tumour lesion was found to consist of medium-sized cells, with medium-sized, vesicular nuclei, with irregular chromatin, some with inconspicuous nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm, others with clear cytoplasm, arranged in a diffuse pattern with extensive haemorrhage and mild mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, without invasion of the renal capsule. No cellular atypia, mitosis or necrosis was found. The tumour cells were positive for vimentin and showed strong and diffuse positivity for CD34. Ultrastructural observation revealed cells with intracytoplasmic granules with different degrees of electrolucency, surrounded by membranes. In terms of morphology, they varied from round to elongated, acquiring some shapes with rectilinear edges, and in some of them a crystalloid rhomboid shape stood out, which at high magnification showed a zigzag structure of marked electrodensity. These findings could be linked to juxtaglomerular cell tumour (JCT), confirming the clinical suspicion.  After surgery, the patient's BP gradually decreased and antihypertensive drugs were simultaneously withdrawn, and she evolved asymptomatic, normotensive, with normal levels of plasma renin, aldosterone and serum potassium, without pharmacological treatment.   "
"A 70-year-old white male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, recurrent atrial fibrillation and right hemithyroidectomy for nodular hyperplasia, as well as unstudied chronic renal failure (baseline creatinine 1.5 mg/dl). He came to the emergency department with three months of clinical manifestations of gait instability and generalised weakness (he had previously been admitted to another centre for these symptoms). On physical examination, the patient was dehydrated, confused, bradypsychic and with distal tremor. The analytical data are summarised in (table 1), highlighting significant deterioration of renal function, severe hypercalcaemia and marked elevation of PTH (twenty times the laboratory reference value). Serum therapy, perfusion of furosemide and intravenous corticosteroids, bisphosphonates and calcitonin were started. Due to the severity of the neurological symptoms, urgent renal replacement therapy by haemodialysis with low calcium concentration in the dialysate was simultaneously indicated. There was a transitory clinical improvement, but due to persistent renal failure and rebound of hypercalcaemia (increase in calcaemia > 2 mg/dl 24 hours post-hemodialysis), daily sessions were required.  As part of the aetiological study, myeloproliferative processes and other neoplasms (no monoclonal component in the proteinogram, negative Bence-Jones proteinuria), infectious pathology (negative serologies) and autoimmune diseases were ruled out. Urinary ultrasound showed kidneys of normal size and adequate cortico-medullary differentiation. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan showed a retroesophageal mass measuring 5.6 × 3.2 × 6.8 cm, suspicious for parathyroid tumour, and the image was confirmed by parathyroid scintigraphy, as well as bilateral hypodense adrenal nodules: right 27 × 18 mm and left 15 × 11 mm. With these findings, the patient consulted Endocrinology, which ruled out pheochromocytoma (negative urine catecholamines and metanephrines). In a joint session with General Surgery it was decided to perform surgery, resecting an 8 cm parathyroid tumour. Anatomical pathology reports parathyroid adenoma without capsular or vascular invasion.  In the immediate postoperative period, ""hungry bone syndrome"" occurred and the patient required intravenous and oral calcium supplementation due to severe hypocalcaemia, and daily haemodialysis sessions for nine days after surgery. Nine months later, the patient is asymptomatic, with calcaemia in range without the need for supplementation, and with partial recovery of renal function (creatinine 2.7 mg/dl). It is noteworthy that renal function remains impaired one year after surgery, despite normalisation of calcaemia.  "
"A 40-year-old man attended the emergency department due to the appearance of oedema. He had a family history of a mother with unrelated renal amyloidosis. The mother's renal biopsy report refers to permanganate resistance, which seems to rule out AA amyloidosis, and leads us to consider, at the time the diagnosis was made, the possibility of AL amyloidosis. The patient is not receiving any pharmacological treatment. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 135/75 mmHg and bimalleolar oedema, with no other data of interest. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of nephrotic syndrome (serum albumin 2.5 g/dl, cholesterolaemia 275 mg/dl and proteinuria 6 g/24 h), with no alterations in the sediment and normal glomerular filtration rate. The electrophoretic spectrum in blood and urine, the immunological study and renal ultrasound were normal. A renal biopsy was performed, showing 19 glomeruli with a totally distorted structure due to a nodular hyaline deposit, with positivity for Congo red and thioflavin; the tubules and vessels showed no significant alterations, the result being compatible with amyloidosis. In the study on the paraffin sample, there was marked positivity for AP protein, which is a part of the amyloid substance common in all types of amyloidosis, with negativity for light chains and AA, B2 microglobulin and transthyretin proteins. A complementary study was performed with antibodies against fibrinogen and lysozyme, and the amyloid substance deposits were positive for the A alpha chain of fibrinogen (Afib). However, the genetic study found no mutation in the Afib chain gene, but demonstrated a previously undescribed mutation in the apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) gene. In view of this discrepancy, the biopsy of the mother was analysed and showed glomerular deposition in the cortex and massive deposition at the medullary level. Deposition at the medullary level is not described in Afib amyloidosis, being very characteristic of apo AI. It is concluded that the initial results of immunohistochemistry are not reliable because they were not performed under the appropriate conditions, and the presence of apo AI was subsequently confirmed by the same technique. An extension study was performed, with echocardiography and electromyography, with no evidence of cardiac involvement or autonomic neuropathy. A progressive increase in transaminases was detected, suggestive of liver involvement. These results are consistent with this type of familial amyloidosis, with preferential renal and hepatic involvement. Despite the initial normality, renal function progressively deteriorated to the point of requiring renal replacement therapy within 2 years. The patient was treated with peritoneal dialysis for 4 years until he underwent surgery and a cadaver donor kidney transplant. He had a complicated postoperative period with splenic rupture, in the context of his disease, with amyloid deposition in the spleen, requiring an urgent splenectomy. Finally, the patient was discharged in stable condition.   "
"We present the case of a 47-year-old male with no family history of SCD who had been seen in our outpatient clinic since 2002 for proteinuria. In 2006, abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed poor cortico-medullary differentiation and the presence of multiple bilateral parapelvic cysts. In 2007, due to deterioration of renal function with serum creatinine levels of 1.6 mg/dl and proteinuria of 1 g/24 h, it was decided to perform an ultrasound-guided renal biopsy, which revealed changes consistent with moderate-severe chronic interstitial nephritis. In 2009, the patient was admitted due to oedema and dyspnoea on exertion. Examination showed no skin lesions suggestive of skin angiokeratomas. The admission blood test showed a serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dl and proteinuria of 2.4 g/24 h. Echocardiogram and cardiac MRI findings showed probable cardiomyopathy due to deposition disease. Electromyography showed signs of small fibre neuropathy, with impaired autonomic function. A sweat test failed to pick up sweat after pilocarpine stimulation, and an ophthalmological examination revealed cornea verticillata.  In clinical suspicion of FS, the level of alpha-galactosidase activity in leukocytes and plasma was determined using a fluorogenic substrate 4-methyilumbelliferyl α-D-galactosidase. GLA activity was 0.5 nmol/h/ml (2% of normal) in plasma, and /4.2 nmol/h/mg protein (10.7% of normal) in leukocytes, confirming the diagnosis of EF. Enzyme activity was normal in the patient's relatives studied (mother and sister). Genetic study was performed, genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from dried blood spot and coding gene fragments were amplified by PCR. Direct sequencing of the 7 exons of the GLA gene was performed using a capillary sequencer (ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer). The analysis determined that the patient was homozygous for a novel c.1182del (single nucleotide deletion) mutation in exon 7 of the alpha-GLA A gene. The patient's mother and sister were investigated and were negative for this mutation. The remaining siblings were not available for study, but none of them have manifested clinical symptoms associated with the disease to date. The patient has one male child, so the mutation is not transmitted to offspring. Hormone replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa (Replagal®) was initiated. During follow-up, oedema and neuropathic pain improved, but renal function progressively worsened to end-stage renal failure, over a period of 3 years. The patient started haemodialysis, and one year later, he received a living donor kidney graft from his wife. The patient, during post-transplant follow-up, has remained with stable renal function with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, with proteinuria of 200 mg/24 h. Follow-up biopsies were performed at 3 months and 1 year, which showed no Gb3 deposits in the renal tissue. Regarding cardiac evolution, clinically, he presented with the appearance of dyspnoea on exertion, in addition to worsening myocardial fibrosis, assessed by cardiac MRI performed in February 2014. It was decided to change treatment to agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme®), since then.  "
"41-year-old male, referred for evaluation due to the finding of proteinuria. Diagnosis of PNH in the context of haemolytic anaemia. He did not require blood transfusions and had no thrombotic events. Laboratory tests showed persistent haemolytic activity, elevated LDH (1,800-3,000 U/l) and undetectable haptoglobin, haemoglobin 8.5 mg/dl, mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, normal ferritin 25 ng/ml. He presented recurrent haemolytic crises with fatigue, dysphagia, abdominal pain and dark urine. Episodes usually lasted 1-3 days, every 2-3 months. Renal function was normal, serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dl and GFR (MDRD) > 60 ml/min. Persistent haemoglobinuria with normal urine sediment, and proteinuria of 1.3 g/day with albuminuria 170 mg/day and non-selective aminoaciduria, indicating DTP. Acid-base status, phosphate and uric acid were normal. The possibility of DTP due to haemosiderin deposition was considered, so an MRI was performed with the finding of bilateral renal cortical hypointensity compatible with iron deposition. Initiation of therapy with eculizumab was considered, but was rejected due to the lack of transfusion requirement and normal GFR.  Two years later, he presented a severe haemolytic crisis with acute renal failure, which was attributed to haemoglobinuria. The patient was treated with conservative measures, with recovery of renal function in 18 days. Following this episode, treatment with eculizumab was started. Within a few weeks, LDH and haemoglobin almost normalised, maintaining low haptoglobin levels. In the following months, tubular proteinuria progressively normalised. Fourteen months after initiation of eculizumab, a new MRI showed an improvement in signal hypointensity in the renal cortex of 34 and 51% in the left and right kidneys, respectively, indicating partial removal of iron deposits in the kidney.  "
"A 40-year-old man with recently diagnosed PNH was referred for renal evaluation. In the previous 9 months he had presented with repeated episodes of dark urine and low back pain. He presented with severe haemolytic anaemia, haemoglobin 7.7 mg/dl, undetectable haptoglobin, elevated LDH 3,800 U/l, requiring red blood cell transfusion. Ferritin and transferan saturation normal. Renal function normal, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, proteinuria 427 mg/24 h, with albuminuria 120 mg/24 h. Haemoglobinuria with normal sediment, negative glycosuria and normal fractional excretion of phosphate. In the following 10 months he presented repeated haemolytic crises, with macroscopic haemoglobinuria. He reported difficulty concentrating and recurrent headache. An MRI showed marked signal hypointensity in the renal cortex on all sequences, and a brain MRI revealed multiple subcortical lacunar lesions. Due to brain involvement attributable to PNH, treatment with eculizumab was initiated.  The patient progressed, with no new haemoglobinuria crises, resolution of anaemia and normalisation of LDH (decreased haptoglobin persisted). Seventeen months after the start of treatment, a new MRI showed normalisation of the signal in the renal cortex. Renal function remained normal, with proteinuria 130mg/day and negative haemoglobinuria.  "
"Sixty-three year old woman with a personal history of kyphoscoliosis, restrictive respiratory insufficiency and diverticulosis. The patient presented with peritonitis secondary to perforated diverticulitis, treated with the Hart-mann technique. Postoperatively, she developed an entero-cutaneous fistula, treated with oral enteral nutrition. Given her refusal to undergo surgery, she was discharged with this treatment, when she presented a debit of 200 ml/day, and periodic outpatient check-ups were scheduled, which she did not attend. Three months later, she went to the emergency department for presenting in the previous days with asthenia, anorexia, nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, decreased stool output through the colostomy and a significant increase in fistula output, sometimes with a haematic appearance. He was afebrile, with a BP of 85/50 mmHg and presented with diffuse pain on abdominal palpation. During his stay in the ED, he presented a decreased level of consciousness that improved after administration of intravenous fluids. Laboratory tests showed: haemoglobin 12.3 g/dl; leucocytes 10,400/mm3; glycaemia 102 mg/dl; urea 426 mg/dl; creatinine 2.9 mg/dl; total protein 9.3 g/dl; Ca 10.5 mg/dl; Na 104 mEq/l; K 6.9 mEq/l; Cl 73 mEq/l; HCO3 17 mmol/l; urinary Na 6 mEq/l. She was diagnosed with dehydration, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, severe hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. Given the suspicion of acute adrenal insufficiency, treatment was started with hydrocortisone and continued with IV fluid replacement, with good clinical and analytical response. Subsequent blood tests showed a drop in haemoglobin concentration to 7.6 g/dl and she received a transfusion of two red blood cell concentrates. She was admitted to internal medicine and subsequently transferred to surgery with a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. On the sixth day of admission she was started on parenteral nutrition. The patient was fully conscious, haemodynamically stable, without oedema and renal function, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia had normalised. She weighed 68 kg and was 145 cm tall (BMI 32 kg/m2). The composition of the TPN was: total volume 2500 ml, 1500 kcal, N 11 g, glucose 200 g, lipids 40 g, Na 120 mEq, K 60 mEq, Mg 15 mEq, P 15 mEq, Zn 12 mg, Ca 12 mEq. The following day the patient reported paresthesia in the hands and perioral region. Thiamine i.m. was administered empirically. A few hours later, she began to present a picture of decreased level of consciousness and bradypsychia, with preserved motility in the extremities. The clinical picture progressed during the following day, presenting with a fluctuating level of consciousness deterioration, with aphasia and paraparesis in MSI and becoming stuporous. She was afebrile and her blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg. NTP was discontinued, she was maintained on serum therapy and empirical vitamin supplementation. Head CT scan was normal. She was transferred to the ICU and, given the suspicion of metabolic encephalopathy, an EEG was performed, which showed non-convulsive status epilepticus, and treatment with IV phenytoin was started. Laboratory tests showed: Hb 10.7 g/l; 12,800 leukocytes with 71.5% granulocytes; glycaemia 91 mg/dl; creatinine 0.5 mg/dl; Na 143 mEq/l; K 2.6 mEq/l; P 0.5 mg/dl; Mg 1.5 mg/dl; CPK 31 UI/l. The ECG showed no arrhythmias. Arterial blood gas analysis was similar to the previous one. She was diagnosed with severe hypophosphataemia with hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia. Phosphate salts were administered i.v., as well as magnesium and potassium, with good clinical response, progressively improving the neurological situation until normalisation. She was again transferred to surgery and parenteral nutrition was restarted, progressively increasing the caloric intake and with a higher intake of phosphorus, magnesium and potassium. During her admission she also presented several complications: phenytoin intoxication with neurological symptoms, and sepsis due to Candida spp. related to the central catheter, from which she recovered without sequelae. Oral enteral nutrition and modified oral diet were progressively introduced and TPN and IV fluids were discontinued. Since the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was not confirmed and there was significant dehydration on admission that could explain the analytical alterations, corticosteroids were progressively decreased until they were discontinued, without the appearance of symptoms or signs of adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol after ACTH stimulation (250 mg) was 43.9 µg/dl at 30 minutes, reflecting a normal adrenal reserve. The patient refused intestinal transit reconstruction surgery. Enterocutaneous fistula persisted with a debit of approximately 300 cc/day. The patient was discharged with good clinical and analytical status. Table I shows the evolution of phosphorus, magnesium and potassium levels during admission.   "
"The patient, a 55-year-old man with no known allergies diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma, was admitted in November 2001 to the Digestive Department of the Hospital Son Dureta where he underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with reconstruction of the transit by means of a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. Five days after the surgery, the patient's clinical situation required the prescription of artificial nutrition, and the administration of TPN via the central line was started. The preparation administered was Kabimix® (see detailed composition in table I), a 2,553 kilocalorie diet supplemented in the Pharmacy Service with a multivitamin preparation (PMV) (Cernevit®) and trace elements (Addamel®) on alternate days. 48 hours after the introduction of parenteral nutrition, it was decided to change the type of diet in order to administer a formula more suited to the patient's nutritional requirements, so the patient received the Kabiven® formula supplemented with the same PMV and trace elements every other day, starting with the vitamins. Within 24 hours of starting the infusion of this diet, the patient presents with a significant disseminated pruritic rash requiring the administration of oral dexchlorpheniramine. Mechanical complications caused the loss of the central line, leading to the decision to withdraw the TPN and initiate oral tolerance. On the eighth day after surgery, the patient reported severe abdominal pain, which led to an exploratory laparotomy and the detection of an abscess with a biliary collection. TPN was restarted by administering the Kabiven® diet supplemented with the aforementioned PMV. A few hours after starting the infusion, a new episode of disseminated pruritic skin rash occurred, which led to the definitive suspension of TPN.  In March 2003, the patient went to the emergency department of the aforementioned hospital for fever and abdominal pain, was diagnosed with cholangitis and was admitted to the Digestive Department. In addition to antibiotic and analgesic treatment, an absolute diet was prescribed and, due to the history of hypersensitivity, TPN was avoided, and an amino acid and glucose solution (Aminoven®, table III) was administered, without erythema being observed or the patient reporting pruritus. After 48 hours, lipid emulsion (Intralipid® 10%, table III) was added centrally without any complications. On this occasion, it was decided not to administer PMV or trace elements to the patient. After several days of hospitalisation, progression of the gastric neoformative process was observed and the patient died in April 2003.   "
"Background: 45-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism accompanied by chronic pancreatitis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, presenting with very low dietary intake. He was admitted to hospital several times for flare-ups of his chronic pancreatitis. In 2002 he underwent surgery to remove a pancreatic pseudocyst which became complicated and ended with a cystogastrostomy which resolved favourably. In February 2003, he was admitted again for emphysematous cholecystitis with complicated perivesicular abscess and a cholecystostomy with Pezzer tube was performed to perform cholecystectomy in a second surgery. He was discharged with a cholecystostomy tube drainage of approximately 500 ml. In November 2003, she attended surgery for a qualitative examination of the stool, which showed an increase in fat and food debris, a foul odour and a pasty consistency. No treatment was prescribed. Current illness: In February 2004, she attended the emergency department with a 3-month history of bilateral eye pain, redness, itching, photophobia and reduced visual acuity. She was admitted to the Ophthalmology Department for study and treatment. Ophthalmological examination revealed peripheral ulcerative keratitis and visual acuity of less than 10% in the right eye. In the left eye, there was a central corneal ulcer with stromal necrosis and hyphema, and she only had light perception. Imaging tests were negative. Corneal cultures were negative. ENT, digestive and rheumatology examinations were not significant. The patient was referred to the Nutrition Unit for weight loss of 16 kg in the last 6 months. The nutritional assessment revealed severe caloric and mild protein malnutrition, weight of 52 kg with a BMI of 18.2 and loss of 23% of her usual weight in the last 6 months, tricipital fold of 5, 2 mm (42% of the 50th percentile for her age and sex), arm muscle circumference of 18.3 (74% of the 50th percentile for her age and sex), hypoproteinaemia with albumin 2.42 g/dl and Retinol Transport Protein 1.5 mg/dl (Reference value: 3.5-7.5 mg/dl), severe deficit of fat-soluble vitamins, especially Vitamin A (Vitamin A: 0.24 ng/ml. Reference value: 0.4-0.8) and vitamin D (Vitamin D: 0, not detectable in blood. Reference value 15-100 ng/ml). Both vitamin B complex vitamins, vitamin C and zinc were normal. The 24-hour stool malabsorption study showed the presence of mild malabsorption (Nitrogen: 2.5 g, faecal fats 6.3 g and faecal sugars 3.8 g), however when this last stool sample was collected the patient was already on treatment with Pancrease®. Treatment: The patient's diet was supplemented with special hyperprotein and hypercaloric formulas for diabetics (Resource diabet® 2 shakes every day), the deficient vitamins were administered orally (Natecal D® 2 tablets every day, Auxin A+E 2 tablets every/day), and pancreatic enzymes were added (Pancrease® 2-0-2). Evolution: In April 2004 cholecystectomy was performed and cholecystostomy was closed. We evaluated the patient 3 months later and he had a BMI of 20, the anaemia had subsided and the ophthalmological problems had evolved favourably. The corneal ulcers have healed and visual acuity has almost completely recovered (right eye 100% and left eye counts fingers (table I).  "
"A 25-year-old female patient came to the Nutrition Clinic for monitoring of her nutritional status; seven months earlier she had been diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and during this period she had received treatment with corticosteroids: methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg/24 h IV during two months of admission and 30 mg/24 h of prednisone orally in a descending dosage for the remaining five months. He reported arthralgia in both knees, and on examination showed pain on posterior rotation in both femoral heads, more evident in the right hip, which also showed limited internal rotation; the left knee had reduced flexion movement, and on gait examination there was claudication to the right side. No markers of autoimmunity were detected, and plasma concentrations of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D were within the normal range. Bone densitometry (BMD) showed osteoporosis at the lumbar spine (T score - 3, 1) and osteopenia at the femoral neck (T score - 1.5). Plain radiographs showed data suggestive of grade II NA in both femoral heads, more evident on the right side; in the knees an osteochondral lesion was observed in the internal femoral condyle of the left knee with irregularities in its articular surface. MRI confirmed necrotic lesions in both femoral heads and in both knees, both on the tibial and femoral side. The next MRI, performed only 3 months later, showed evidence of subsidence in the right hip.  The patient was treated with alendronate and calcium and vitamin D supplementation for osteoporosis, corticosteroids were discontinued and weight bearing of the affected joints was advised.   "
"A 19-year-old female in her first intrauterine pregnancy was diagnosed with brain death following a suicide attempt by means of a gunshot wound to the right occipital level. Ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a live product of 19.6 weeks' gestation with no macroscopic malformations. The patient's family requested to continue advanced life support manoeuvres in order to save the product and eventually consider the mother as a potential organ donor. The ethics committee of the institution decides to continue with basic and somatic life support. Once haemodynamic stability was achieved, management was initiated by the Nutrition Service, emphasising the importance of nutritional support to promote the growth and development of the product. At 20.3 weeks of gestation, mixed nutritional and metabolic support was started, both enteral and parenteral. Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) was estimated using the Harris-Benedict prediction formula, adding the theoretical energy and protein component established for gestational age. The energy and protein intake was increased gradually and gradually according to biochemical monitoring in order to prevent refeeding syndrome behaviour. After 5 days of mixed feeding and once tolerance and nutritional adequacy by enteral route had been established, parenteral support was discontinued. Enteral intake was maintained at total macro- and micronutrient requirements using a mixture of standard polymeric formula, high protein formula and modular trace element formula. A minimum gestational age of 24-26 weeks was established to consider the possibility of extrauterine life according to previous reports in the literature. Gestational weight was monitored serially by weekly ultrasound and fetal well-being was monitored by biophysical profile measurement. The relationship between ultrasound weight gain and energy intake is shown in figure 1.  Haemodynamic, ventilatory and metabolic stability was maintained with the usual management measures without evidence of uterine activity or foetal distress by tocographic monitoring for 22 days. Suddenly, on the 23rd day of ICU stay (22.4 weeks gestation, 12th day of nutritional support), she presented hypertensive dyscontrol with uterine activity and transvaginal bleeding. Obstetric ultrasound showed placental abruption and foetal death. With the loss of the product and in accordance with the purposes established for continuing vital and somatic management in the ICU, the mother's organs were explanted for donation (liver, heart, kidney and cornea). The foetal autopsy showed a male product weighing 450g. Macroscopic age of 23 weeks of gestation, with no evidence of malformations.   "
"A 32-year-old man, with no pathological history of interest and no previous treatment, operated on for tearing of the splenic hilum, mesentery of the root of the jejunum and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) due to trauma. Resection of the right colon, ileum and 2/3 of the jejunum with jejunostomy and splenectomy was performed. After the postoperative period and undergoing TPN, progressive oral tolerance was started with sugar infusions, defatted broths, alkaline lemonade (WHO formula) to introduce small and frequent oral intakes of elemental enteral formula (Elemental 0.28 Extra liquid®) and 3 intakes of 5 grams of glutamine (Adamín G®) in order to stimulate trophism and adaptation of the enterocyte. At 6 months, the 12 cm of jejunum is anastomosed with the left colon and cholecystectomy is performed to avoid further choleretic diarrhoea. From this point on, the objective is to maintain a stable nutritional status, a diuresis of more than 1 litre/day and control of diarrhoea, assessing daily balances and determining haematological and biochemical parameters twice a week. Nutritional management It is structured as follows: a) Parenteral nutrition: TPN is replaced by 2 litres of Isoplasmar G® with the addition of an ampoule of 10 mEq of potassium/litre and the vitamin module (Addamel®) on alternate days with the trace element module (Cernevit®). b) Oral enteral nutrition: 4-5 intakes of ""Elemental 0.28 Extra Liquid"" and 3 intakes of 5 g of ""Adamín G®"" are maintained interspersed with food. c) Oral hydration: ""alkaline lemonade"" is given on demand and between meals. d) Feeding: with progressive criteria, starting with easily digestible and easily absorbed foods and with less secretory stimulus to continue with those of greater difficulty. From a diet of simple carbohydrates and cooked starches, depending on the rhythm, volume and characteristics of the faeces, protein foods (skimmed dairy products, egg whites, fish and lean meats) are included, followed by the addition of oil, to then assess tolerance to cooked vegetables and pulses. In all cases, small, frequent and easy-to-prepare intakes are recommended. e) Medication: to reduce chlorhydropeptide secretion and stimulate the secretion of water and pancreatic bicarbonate, omeprazole (40 mg/day) is combined with 2 capsules of pancreatic enzymes (Kreon 10,000®) with food intake to facilitate the digestibility of natural foods and their absorption. The appearance of abdominal distention due to fermentation resulting from the excess HC in the first phase accelerated the transition to a normal, highly fractionated diet free of fried foods, animal fats and moderate HC, and the aerocolia was controlled. Three months after jejunocolic anastomosis, nutritional stability, diuresis and 4-6 liquid-pasty stools were maintained. He was discharged from hospital with the aforementioned treatment and with a reservoir for nocturnal fluid therapy of 1-2 litres of Isoplasmar G depending on diuresis. He was evaluated by the intestinal transplant unit of the Ramón y Cajal Hospital in Madrid and 14 months after starting enteral nutrition, the indication for transplant was rejected due to his good nutritional status. Fluid therapy was suspended, maintaining diuresis above 1,200 mL/day, 3-5 stools of pasty or formed consistency (depending on the type of intake) and stable anthropometric and analytical parameters with hypolipaemia. The rapid loss of 7-8 kg after withdrawal of fluid therapy is noteworthy, finally stabilising at 64 kg, for a height of 175 cm and a usual weight of 70 kg. She is independent and maintains moderate physical activity. She follows a free diet with frequent small meals, limited only by specific intolerances, and frequently drinks mineralised beverages. He has been prescribed: ""Elemental 0.28 Extra Liquid"" (800 kcal/day), 2 capsules of ""Kreon 10.000®"" with each meal, 2 tablets of ""Supradyn®"" (double the RDA for micronutrients) and 1.000 mcg of vitamin B12 im per month. During the course of the evolution, a depletion of vitamins D, B12 and folic acid was detected, which was corrected with the corresponding shock dose. Tables I, II and III show the analytical determinations of nutrients carried out during the period from 6 months after the intervention to the last one carried out, where a stable and progressive nutritional state within normality is observed.

"A 44-year-old man with Crohn's disease diagnosed 15 years previously, who was admitted to the general surgery department for abdominal pain and diarrhoea of one week's duration, compatible with a flare-up of his disease. Under home treatment with corticoids and mesalazine, the patient has had an ileostomy for 2 years following a subtotal colectomy with a closed rectal stump following a flare-up of his disease. He had previously undergone several resective operations such as removal of the last 40 centimetres of the ileum, ileocaecal valve and cecum, following ileocaecal perforation, as well as other operations for anal fistula with abscess in the buttock, for drainage. During the current admission, he developed a polymicrobial perianal infection resistant to medical treatment with antibiotics, so he underwent surgery in which he underwent an abdominoperineal amputation, resecting his rectum. The postoperative course was uneventful until, on the tenth day, he suffered a generalised tonic-clonic seizure lasting 3 minutes, without sphincter incontinence. A general biochemistry was performed, showing a calcium corrected for albumin of 8.42 mg/dl (rn: 8.7-10.6), K 2.6 mg/dl (rn: 3.6-4.9), albumin 2.5 mg/dl (rn 4-5.2), glucose and sodium within the reference values. Subsequently, a cranial CAT scan was performed, which showed no abnormalities. An electrocardiogram on the day of admission showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 bpm, without QT or PR space elongation. Two days later, he again presented with a generalised tonic-clonic seizure lasting one minute. After being assessed by the Neurology Department, an electroencephalogram was performed with no pathological findings and treatment with carbamazepine was started. Given the persistence of seizures of the same characteristics despite medical treatment, a 24-hour electroencephalographic recording was performed, which showed no alterations. Given that the patient showed signs of dehydration and malnutrition, as well as decreased intake and asthenia, a referral was made to the Nutrition Unit for assessment of nutritional support if necessary. On questioning, she reported paresthesia in the lower limbs, which she recently perceived more as intense pruritus, with no other symptoms. He also refers that he has had 3 convulsive episodes of similar characteristics to the current ones in the last 5 months, with no subsequent clinical repercussions, having consulted the Emergency Department on one occasion, where, as it was the first convulsive episode, no antiepileptic treatment was prescribed. On examination, the patient weighed 55.1 kg and was 172 cm tall (BMI 18.63 kg/m2). He reported a weight loss of 7 kg in the last 6 months, which represents a weight loss/time ratio of 15.23%, implying severe malnutrition. The examination revealed mild cutaneous-mucosal dehydration and a moderate decrease in fat and muscle mass, which was subsequently diagnosed as moderate mixed energy-protein malnutrition, according to the anthropometric and biochemical parameters of the classic nutritional assessment. The rest of the physical examination was normal, with no clinical signs of hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia such as Trosseau's sign, Chovstek's sign, muscle spasms, tremor or tendon hyporeflexia. A dietary history for the months prior to admission showed that his calorie intake was insufficient for his needs and that he was also deficient in certain food groups such as dairy products, fruit, vegetables and red meat. Given the existence of dehydration with negative water balances due to a high ileostomy debit, and low blood electrolyte levels, monitored parenteral treatment was started to replace volume, electrolytes and other micronutrients, including phosphorus and magnesium. Prior to this, a blood sample was taken to determine these micronutrients in view of the suspicion of a possible deficiency. That same day the patient suffered a seizure similar to the previous ones. The blood test showed a magnesium level of 0.76 mg/dl (rn: 2.40-5.40) with phosphorus, calcium, potassium and sodium within the reference values. A perfusion with high doses of magnesium sulphate was prescribed with progressive normalisation of her blood levels, with high doses of oral magnesium lactate being sufficient for maintenance treatment, as maintenance treatment. After stabilising the figures with oral administration, the patient was taken off the anti-epileptic medication, and no further episodes of seizures occurred.   "
"We present the case of a 35-year-old female patient. She was referred to our unit after her third hospital admission in the previous 18 months for recurrent chylous ascites. With no previous history of interest, she was admitted for the first time with ascites and mild oedema in the lower limbs for a month and a half, and underwent an exploratory laparotomy on suspicion of ovarian neoplasia. Twelve litres of ascitic fluid with chylous characteristics were evacuated, with no ovarian abnormalities or peritoneal carcinomatosis. She was discharged with diuretic treatment with spironolactone 100 mg and prednisone 40 mg in descending doses, after 5 months she was readmitted, and 9 litres of chylous fluid were extracted by evacuating paracentesis. On a new admission 6 months later, during which time the symptoms had progressively reappeared, 14 more litres of peritoneal fluid were evacuated. Throughout his hospital stay, the following complementary tests were performed: blood count, with discrete leukocytosis and normal formula, iron study without alterations; biochemical profile, with hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia, hypocalcaemia. Celiac profile, HBsAg, HCV-Ac, tumour markers and Mantoux tests were negative. ASLO, C-reactive protein and serum a-1 antitrypsin levels were normal. Thyroid function study was normal. The serum proteinogram showed decreased values of albumin and gamma globulins. The ascitic fluid extracted showed exudate characteristics and a chylous appearance. His culture was negative. Thoracoabdominal CT showed normal thorax, ascites in all peritoneal compartments, oedema in small bowel loops. Abdominal ultrasound showed abundant peritoneal ascitic fluid, with normal liver, portal, great vessels, gall bladder and spleen. Fibroenteroscopy, reaching the cecum, showed from the bulb to the sections of jejunum explored, irregularity in the villous pattern, oedema of folds and numerous punctate lymphangiectasias. Ileoscopy was performed and the terminal ileum showed an extremely irregular mucosa, with whitish, friable plaques on biopsy. The capsuloendoscopy showed diffuse involvement of the small intestine, with punctiform ""millet grain"" formations and oedematous and congestive folds. Biopsy of the intestinal mucosa was reported as lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, focal lymphangiectasia; and gastric, duodenal and jejunal mucosa biopsy showed no significant alterations. Treatment was started with diuretics and intravenous albumin, presenting a favourable clinical evolution, being discharged with the diagnosis of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, with home treatment with Furosemide 40 mg, Spironolactone 100 mg and Prednisone 30 mg, being referred to the Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics Unit for assessment and follow-up. Examination in the consulting room showed a height of 1.65 m, weight 53.5 kg, BMI 19.3 kg/m2, after evacuation of 14 L of ascitic fluid during her admission; subjectively she was thinner than before the onset of symptoms. Skin pallor, long-lined fingers, discrete symmetrical malleolar oedema. The rest of the physical examination was normal. No usual gastrointestinal symptoms, except for 1-2 bowel movements per day with a somewhat greasy appearance. She has a varied diet, always avoiding excessively fatty foods due to intolerance. She denies toxic habits. Nuligesta. Laboratory tests showed serum values of total protein 3.4 g/dL, albumin 2.1 g/dL, calcium 7.3 mg/dL. The rest of the basic biochemistry, lipidogram and haemogram were normal. We decided to start dietary treatment. A personalised diet of 2,200 kcal in 24 hours and the following distribution of nutrients was established: 52% carbohydrates, 30% lipids, 18% proteins. The intake of fats from food is restricted, and lipids are provided in the form of MCT oil, using 85 ml per day, introduced into the diet progressively to avoid intolerances. The protein intake of the diet is supplemented with 400 ml of hyperprotein formula for enteral nutrition and 20 g of powdered protein module. A vitamin-mineral supplement is also added. The patient is cooperative and shows strict compliance with the recommended guidelines, with good adaptation and excellent tolerance. After 11 months of follow-up, she has achieved weight gain, with a weight of 59.3 kg and BMI 21.4. The analytical parameters have improved significantly, with serum values of total protein 5.2 g/L, albumin 3.7 g/L, calcium 8.5 mg/dL. There are no gastrointestinal symptoms. Waist circumference was 78 cm, and no free fluid was observed in the abdomen on abdominal ultrasound. She has not presented new episodes of ascites and has not required hospital admission during this period.   "
"The patient was a 77-year-old man with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation who suffered massive intestinal ischaemia with resection of the jejunum, ileum, ascending colon and half of the transverse colon and underwent jejuno-colic anastomosis. After a hospital stay of two months he was sent home with NPD seven days a week, infusing for 10 hours. His usual caregiver was his 72-year-old wife, who had incipient Parkinson's disease. He also had a very involved close family. NPD was maintained for 11 years, being discontinued following clinical deterioration caused by community-acquired pneumonia. The total duration was 3,940 days. During this period she had 5 catheter-associated infections (infection rate: 1.3 episodes per 1,000 days of NPD) and 1 accidental catheter exit. The catheter needed to be replaced 4 times (catheter half-life: 788 days). He had mild, non-progressive hepatic steatosis since two years after the onset of NPD. He was hospitalised on four occasions due to complications of the technique. His functional status at the start of NPD was that of an active independent life and he became sedentary but autonomous at the end of NPD. During the first eight years of NPD he travelled once or twice a year for a few days' holiday at the beach.   "
"This is a 60-year-old male with a personal history of ischaemic heart disease (he suffered an acute myocardial infarction in 2004) and is a former smoker. The patient had no known drug or food allergies. In July 2008 he was diagnosed with primary amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome. On discharge from hospital, he received nutritional recommendations from the nephrology department to follow a low-sodium and low-fat diet and to exclude protein foods. To this end, the patient had to cook all food, not use table salt, and could not use any other cooking techniques (frying, grilling, roasting, microwaving, etc.), as well as not eating the second courses (meat, fish and eggs). The pharmacological treatment she is currently receiving is omeprazole, candesartan, enalapril, atorvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid, ezetimibe, furosemide, barnidipine and spironolactone. She attended the diet therapy consultation to establish a diet adjusted to her nutritional needs. At the initial consultation, a nutritional history was taken, including a complete anthropometric assessment, biochemistry and analysis of intake through a 3-day dietary survey analysed with the Dietsource 3.0 ®Nestlé Healthcare Nutrition software (2005 Edition). The baseline intake characteristics are shown in table I, together with the nutritional recommendations for the patient with nephrotic syndrome: restrictive diet in protein, salt and lipid profile rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids3 . The following results were obtained in the initial examination:  - Anthropometry: weight 86.7 kg, height 171 cm, BMI 29.65 kg/m2. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance (TANITA TBF 300®): 56.1 litres of water (64.7%), 76.6 kg of lean mass (88.4%) and 10.1 kg of fat mass (11.6%). The patient had oedema with pitting up to the knees. - CBC: Creatinine: 0.95 (normal values 0.5-1.1) mg/dL, Glomerular Filtration: > 60 ml/min/1.72 m2, P: 3.31 (normal values 2.5-4.5) mg/dL, K: 4.23 (normal values 3.6-5) mmol/L, Total Protein: 3.8 (normal values 6.2 - 8) gr/dL.

Dietary adherence: Dietary intake was collected in a 24-hour recall and analysed with the same software as at the baseline visit. The data are shown in table I. At present the patient continues with the prescribed diet and continues to attend the diet therapy consultation bimonthly.   "
"65-year-old patient with a personal history of alcoholism and chronic alcoholic liver disease. He underwent surgery in January 2008 for stenosing adenocarcinoma of the sigma, performing a subtotal colectomy and terminal ileostomy in the right iliac fossa. Eight months later, reconstruction of the intestinal transit with end-to-end anastomosis and closure of the ileostomy was performed. Shortly afterwards (November 2008) the patient was admitted for faecaloid peritonitis, and a resection of 1.5 metres of small intestine was performed, leaving a definitive terminal ileostomy with a rectal stump left in the pelvis, with no possibility of subsequent reconstruction. Two months after the second operation (January 2009) the patient was admitted to hospital again due to acute renal failure and secondary hydroelectrolytic alterations, together with ileostomy debit greater than 1500 ml/day. At that time he was being treated with Tramadol, Paracetamol, oral iron and a loop diuretic (Furosemide) due to the presence of oedema in the lower limbs. Subsequently, he returned to the hospital on several occasions and was treated in the emergency department, with renal failure and dehydration, together with water and electrolyte disorders, which were resolved in the department itself and did not require hospital admission. In July 2009, she returned to the emergency department due to worsening general condition, with significant asthenia, prostration, difficulty in ambulation and oliguria. Laboratory tests performed in the ED showed: Creatinine: 4 mg/dl (LN 0.6-1.40); Sodium: 113 meq (LN 135-145), Potassium: 6.7 mEq/l (LN 3.5-5), Albumin: 3.1 g/dl (LN 3.4-4); Plasma calcium: 6.7 mg/dl (LN 8.5-10.5); Calcium corrected with albumin: 7.4 mg/dl; Magnesium: 0.5 mg/dl (LN 1.5-10.5); Calcium corrected with albumin: 7.4 mg/dl; Magnesium: 0. 5 mg/dl (LN 1.7-2.5); Phosphate: 2.8 mg/dl (LN 2.5-4.5); Venous pH: 7.17 (LN 7.33-7.43); Bicarbonate: 18 mmol/l (LN 22-28); The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for acute renal failure with hyperlactacidemic metabolic acidosis and electrolyte disturbances secondary to ileostomy losses and diuretic treatment. After several days of parenteral rehydration he was discharged. The diuretic was then discontinued and treatment was started with oral rehydration salts, Loperamide (2 mg/8 hours) and magnesium salts (Magnesium Lactate: 500 mg per tablet = 2 mmol = 4 meq of Mg element) at a dose of 8 meq/8 hours/vo). One week later, the patient suffered syncope at home with a fall to the floor and mild craniocerebral trauma to the right frontal region. On arrival at the emergency department, he had two convulsive episodes of tonic-clonic seizures that subsided with iv diazepam. A few minutes later he suffered a third seizure, for which reason treatment was started with IV phenytoin and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). A cranial CT scan was performed showing minimal subarachnoid haemorrhage in the left suprasylvian region secondary to the CT scan. ECG and chest X-ray with no significant alterations. Laboratory tests showed ionic Ca: 2.3 mg/dl (LN 3.9-5.2); 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 10 ng/ml (LN 11-40), Magnesium 0.5 mg/dl; Sodium 125 meq, Potassium 2.8 meq. IV treatment was started with serum therapy for rehydration, as well as IV treatment with magnesium sulphate, calcium gluconate and potassium chloride to correct the electrolyte deficits. During his stay in the ICU he did not present new episodes of seizures or neurological focality, and on discharge from this department his magnesium, calcium and potassium levels had normalised. A referral to the Nutrition Unit was then requested and the physical examination revealed a weight of 63 kg (usual weight one year earlier: 74 kg), height 1.68 m; BMI 22.3 kg/m2, together with signs of a decrease in lean mass and fat mass. During the 3 weeks that the patient was hospitalised, he was treated with dietary measures such as: astringent diet, low in fat and simple sugars, 30 minutes rest after meals, fluid intake outside meals. In addition, treatment was started with oral rehydration salts (Sueroral®), Loperamide (14 mg/day), Codeine (90 mg/day), oral magnesium supplements (up to 60 meq/day, divided into 4 intakes), calcium carbonate (500 mg) + Cholecalciferol (400 IU) every 8 hours. The Ileostomy debit was 1500-2000 ml/day at baseline and 800-1000 ml/day at discharge. Her nutritional status improved with normalisation of nutritional parameters: cholesterol, albumin, Prealbumin and Retinol Binding Protein. Weight decreased from 63 to 61 kg, and malleolar and pretibial oedema disappeared. At discharge, Mg levels were below normal, although relatively ""safe"" (Mg 1.3); with magnesiuria of 14.7 (LN 50-150), sodium, potassium, total calcium, ionic calcium and chlorine within normal range. In the last days of admission, it was decided to change the Cholecalciferol for Calcitriol (0.25 micrograms/day), in order to favour and improve magnesium absorption, maintaining the doses of oral calcium (1500 mg/day). PTH levels at discharge were normalised (38pg/ml), as were vitamin D levels (20ng/ml). The patient is currently undergoing check-ups at the Nutrition Clinic, presenting good general condition, ileostomy debits of 1000 + 200 ml/day; with Mg levels within normal range (1.9 mg/dl), as well as the rest of the electrolytes, having been able to progressively reduce the doses of magnesium lactate to 9 comp/day (36 meq/day of elemental Mg) and the doses of calcitriol to 0.25 μg/48 hours.   "
"25-year-old woman, smoker of about 10 cigarettes/day, with no other history of interest. She was admitted for symptoms of > 5 diarrhoeal stools, sometimes accompanied by blood and weight loss. Colonoscopy was performed and normal colonic mucosa was observed. In the terminal ileum, three irregularly shaped ulcerations with a fibrinous background were seen. Biopsies were taken, confirming the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Laboratory tests showed an albumin level of 2,890 mg/dl with no other findings. She was referred to the Nutrition Department, where no protein catabolism, reduced intake or other causes of malnutrition were observed. A1AT in blood: 159 mg/dl; A1AT in stool: 1.28 mg/g; stool weight in 24h: 182.84 g. A1AT clearance was 147.19 ml/day (> 56 ml/day), confirming the diagnosis of PLE. After treatment with azathioprine and hyperprotein nutritional supplements, the patient improved clinically, with serum albumin rising to 3,270 mg/dl.  "
"41-year-old male, with a personal history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis, with no other personal history of interest except moderate alcoholic drinker. He was referred to our centre due to a gradual increase in abdominal circumference since the previous month, together with oedema in the lower limbs. No other accompanying symptoms. Laboratory tests showed altered coagulation (prothrombin time 43%), creatinine 0.58 mg/dl, cholesterol 77 mg/dl, albumin 1,610 mg/dl. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis and portal hypertension, together with collateral circulation and ascites, all probably related to excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages (virological study for hepatitis was negative). Gastroscopy revealed grade III oesophageal varices, a small hiatus hernia and gastropathy secondary to portal hypertension. Given the clinical and analytical findings, protein-losing disease was suspected, so A1AT clearance was performed and was 45 ml/day (> 24 ml/day) [A1AT in blood: 190 mg/dl; A1AT in stool: 0.38 mg/g; stool weight in 24h: 225 g], and he was diagnosed with the same, in relation to his portal hypertension. He was treated with alcohol abstinence, oral hyperproteic nutritional supplements and diuretics, improving clinically and analytically, and was discharged for outpatient follow-up at his reference centre.  "
"A 57-year-old man with a history of chronic active alcoholism and secondary alcoholic liver disease, who had previously been admitted to the Acute Psychiatric Unit for manic symptoms related to alcohol intake. He was admitted to Neurology from the emergency department due to clinical symptoms of progressive deterioration over a week's time, with the impossibility of bipe-destation and a decrease in the level of consciousness in the last 24 hours. The patient was afebrile, with a BP of 120/75 mmHg, tachycardic, tachypneic and icteric. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. Neurologically, he presented somnolence, mild bilateral mydriasis, bilateral facial weakness with the rest of the cranial nerves normal, muscle weakness in all four limbs (lack of cooperation for balance) and generalised hyporeflexia. No tremor or agitation was observed. Emergency laboratory tests showed elevated blood glucose (233 mg/dL), normal renal function, hypokalaemia, metabolic acidosis with normal lactate and respiratory alkalosis (pH: 7.3, bicarbonate: 11.9 mmol/L, base excess: -14.4 mmol/L, pO2: 104 mmHg, pCO2: 24 mmHg, lactate: 2.8 mmol/L). Treatment was started with intravenous hydration (5% dextrose and saline), potassium (K) replacement, parenteral thiamine administration and hepatic anti-encephalopathy measures. On the hospital ward, the patient's neurological condition was similar. Laboratory tests showed worsening hypokalaemia, severe hypo-phosphataemia, mild hypomagnesaemia, hypernatraemia, persistent acid-base balance disturbances and the presence of methylketone in urine. We do not have chlorine levels on admission to calculate the GAP anion, nor ketone bodies in the blood. The electrocardiogram corresponded to sinus rhythm and showed no alterations associated with electrolyte deficits. At that time, the Nutrition Unit was consulted to assist in the management of the patient. Hydration was continued with 5% dextrose only, without saline, the administration of parenteral thiamine already started in the ED was maintained at a dose of 100 mg/day and aggressive replacement of the different deficits was carried out intravenously. Initially, 40 mmol of monopotassium phosphate was administered in 6 hours (corresponding in our case to about 0.55 mmol of P/kg body weight), after which a 5% glucose perfusion with 140 mEq of potassium chloride (2 mEq of K/kg body weight) and 24 mEq of Mg (3 g of magnesium sulphate) was prescribed over the following 24 hours. By the end of this period the acid-base balance abnormalities and hypernatraemia had been corrected. However, it was necessary to maintain this high replacement rate of P (0.55 mmol P/kg/day) and K (2 mEq K/kg/day between potassium chloride and monopotassium phosphate) for 72 hours to achieve normalisation. Figure 1 shows the daily evolution of serum K, P and Mg levels until complete correction. The analytical improvement was accompanied by clinical improvement, which allowed oral supplementation with progressive withdrawal of parenteral intake.  Simultaneously, the Neurology Department continued to carry out diagnostic studies. Computerised axial tomography showed no evidence of acute endocranial pathology, although there were clear signs of corticosubcortical atrophy. The cerebrospinal fluid had a slightly xanthochromic appearance, without cells, with glucose 101 mg/dL, protein 95 mg/dL, and Adenosine deaminase 5.5 IU/L. The electroencephalogram showed rapid low-voltage baseline activity, without asymmetries, focality or triphasic components; and the electromyogram suggested severe axonal predominant polyradicular sensory-motor involvement of the lower extremities (LES) and mild involvement of the upper extremities (EESS). At the time of discharge the patient was fully alert, with weakness 4/5 in EESS and EEII. Definitive diagnoses were: alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA), severe hypophosphataemia and hypokalaemia, mild hypomagnesaemia, and confusional syndrome and acute axonal sensory-motor polyradiculoneuritis secondary to severe hypophosphataemia.

"A 37-year-old woman diagnosed with LAM in 2003 as a result of spontaneous right haemopneumothorax requiring surgery with evacuation of the haemothorax and resection of bullous dystrophy. He was followed up as an outpatient without incident until 2009 when he presented with chylous ascites and a large retroperitoneal cystic lymphangioma was detected on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. In February 2011, he was admitted for exertional dyspnoea and extensive right pleural effusion. The pleural fluid showed characteristics of chylothorax: pH 7.43; triglycerides 1,216 mg/dl; cholesterol 73 mg/dl, leukocytes 2,700 cells/μl (mononuclear 92%), protein 4.5 g/dl, LDH 142 U/l. The patient had a weight of 57 kg, height 169 cm, BMI: 19.2 and had normal blood protein and lymphocyte values. Initially, conservative treatment with evacuating thoracentesis, fat-free diet and oral nutritional supplements (ONS) rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) was performed. After one week, the patient presented respiratory worsening and a right thoracic drainage tube was placed, obtaining 2,000-4,000 ml/day of pleural fluid. Given the amount of pleural fluid, parenteral nutrition (PN) was started and treatment with octeotride was started at increasing doses up to 100 μg/8 h, which was discontinued a few days later due to digestive intolerance and severe water and electrolyte disturbance. Despite digestive rest, pleural effusion increased and became bilateral, requiring bilateral thoracic drainage. Three pleurodesis with talc were performed, which were partially effective and did not allow removal of the drainage. Despite treatment, the patient's nutritional status deteriorated, with a weight loss of 5 kg, hypoalbuminaemia of 1.8 g/dL and lymphopenia of 700 cells/μl. During treatment with PN, she developed a catheter-associated infection that required withdrawal of the central line and suspension of the catheter. The fat-free oral diet was progressively reintroduced with MCT-rich ODS. The debit of both thoracic drains decreased progressively and after two and a half months of hospitalisation the patient was discharged from hospital with both thoracic drainage tubes and bowel movements every 3 days with a debit of 500 ml/day, with an albumin of 2 g/dl and lymphocytes of 700 cells/μl. Subsequent evolution was good and the pleural drains were removed 4 and 6 months after discharge, with a progressive improvement in the patient's nutritional status. At present, there is still minimal bilateral pleural effusion, predominantly on the right, which has not changed in the last 4 months, the patient has no dyspnoea at rest although she requires home oxygen therapy and has a BMI of 18.7, with normal nutritional parameters.   "
"A 31-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis on treatment with interferon and bulimia nervosa, diagnosed two years ago, came to the emergency department for acute abdominal pain after a binge. She was undergoing individual and group psychotherapeutic treatment. She denies self-harm attempts or previous psychiatric admissions. She started binge eating when she was 15 years old in relation to the stress caused by exams and since then, her life has revolved around binge eating and purgative behaviours. She reports that binge eating interferes with a normal working and social life. Since the onset of the eating disorder, the number of binges exceeds monthly. The purgative measures she habitually uses are induced vomiting and laxatives. The patient comes to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain of 7 hours' duration, accompanied by a feeling of fullness, nausea and vomiting. She reported having eaten a large amount of food in the last few hours, after which she had induced vomiting on several occasions without being effective. Physical examination revealed the patient's thinness: height 159 cm, weight 42 kg (BMI: 17), the patient's abdomen was globular, tympanic, with scarce bowel sounds. Temperature 36.3 oC, blood pressure 125/65 mmHg and heart rate 75 bpm. Plain abdominal X-ray showed a large gastric dilatation. Lymphocyte count: 19,800 with 93.5% neutrophils. Amylase 286 IU/l, glycaemia: 229 mg/dl, Na: 147 mmol/L, K: 3.2 mmol/L, LDH: 570 and creatinine kinase (CK) of 92. He was prescribed IV fluids, enemas and nasogastric tube placement. Neither the enemas nor the nasogastric tube were effective. Ten hours later, the patient went into preshock. Physical examination showed lividity in the lower limbs and weakness of the paedial pulses, as well as a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure 80/60. Blood glucose: 430 mg/dl, amylase: 1,485 Ul/l, ALAT: 1,008 U/L, LDH: 8,102, CK: 8,310, C-reactive protein: 32 ng/ml and metabolic acidosis with pH: 7.07, PO2: 32 mmHg, PCO2: 78 mmHg, bicarbonate: 22.6 mEq/l and lactic acid of 33 mg/dl. Computed tomography examination showed large gastric dilatation, occupying most of the abdominal cavity with a hydro-aerial level and aortic compression. The large gastric dilatation compresses the rest of the abdominal structures including the great vessels, aorta and cava and their branches, which is the cause of the low attenuation coefficient images identified in the pancreas and kidneys in relation to areas of ischaemia of these viscera.  Given the severity of the patient, and the absence of improvement with conservative measures, a laparotomy and gastrotomy was performed with extraction of food material (approximately 7 litres) from the gastric chamber, in which a large amount of undigested food debris was found. Two days later, a control CT scan was performed, which showed a significant decrease in the volume of the gastric chamber and the restoration of the aortic calibre, as well as the recovery of normal renal and pancreatic perfusion. After 4 weeks of admission to the ICU, due to the existence of multi-organ failure related to hypoperfusion of abdominal viscera, acute hepatic failure due to toxic-ischaemic hepatitis and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, pancreatic ischaemia, intestinal ischaemia, circulatory shock, abdominal ischaemic-perfusion syndrome, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure, she was discharged from the ICU in good clinical condition.   "
"A 23-year-old patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease of ileal location. She initially presented with an inflammatory pattern that evolved into stenosis (occasional subocclusive crises) and later into perforation, leading to abdominal perforation with faecaloid peritonitis, which led to 3 surgical interventions during a stay abroad. Due to numerous postoperative complications, short bowel syndrome and enteroenteric and enterocutaneous fistula, she was transferred to our hospital. On admission she presented with fever, wound infection with skin dehiscence and severe malnutrition. She had a protective ileostomy, directed fistulisation at the ileo-colic anastomosis with Petzer catheter and abdominal drains. She was started on Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) from the time of admission, with gradual introduction of the new feeding. Throughout the entire period, monitoring is carried out by the Nutrition Section of the Pharmacy Service. TPN is prepared on a daily basis, adjusting the intake according to biochemical parameters and clinical evolution. After 7 days, he developed cholestasis, so it was decided to reduce and subsequently eliminate the lipid intake in the TPN. On day 68, TPN was withdrawn due to the onset of oral tolerance, being reintroduced 5 days later due to persistent enterocutaneous fistula that caused fever, abdominal pain and significant weight loss. After removal of drains and Petzer tube and introduction of treatment with Infliximab, she was discharged from hospital on day 85, continuing with TPN at home until she recovered her nutritional state necessary to undergo intestinal reconstruction surgery. She is monitored on an outpatient basis by the Home Hospitalisation Unit (HADO) and the Parenteral Nutrition Section of the Pharmacy Service. The TPN is prepared daily in the Pharmacy Service, and staff from the HADO Unit are in charge of its administration, maintenance of the infusion line and clinical follow-up of the patient. The patient and her family also received instructions on how to use the administration equipment. This allowed the patient, despite the intrinsic limitations, to adapt the administration of TPN to her daily activity. In addition, a general biochemistry was performed every week, the results of which allowed us to monitor the patient and modify the intake according to her needs. During this period, the daily intake (mean ± standard deviation) of macronutrients was 12.2 ± 0.62 g of nitrogen and 1,400 ± 71 kcal of non-protein. The mean micronutrient intakes were: sodium 92 ± 14.2 mEq, chlorine 82.6 ± 14.6 mEq potassium 100 ± 36.4 mEq, phosphorus 10.6 ± 1.3 mEq, calcium 7 ± 0.03mEq, magnesium 11.7 ± 0.06 mEq and zinc 3 mg. Trace elements (Mn, Cr, Cu, Se) are added to the mixture once a week. As for the evolution of biochemical parameters (mean ± standard deviation): glucose 95 ± 15.1 mg/dl (range 70-100), urea 56 ± 25.1 mg/dl (range 10-50), creatinine 1 ± 0.18 mg/dl (range 0.6-1.2), natraemia 136 ± 1, 7 mg/dl (range 135-145), chloremia 94 ± 5.5 mg/dl (range 96-110), potassemia 3 ± 0.47 mg/dl (range 3.5-5.1), albumin 4 ± 0.3 mg/dl (range 3.55.2), total protein 7 ± 2.9 mg/dl (range 6.2-8.3), phosphataemia 4 ± 0.57 mg/dl (range 2.6-4.5), calcaemia 10 ± 0.43 mg/dl (range 8.4-10.4), magnesaemia 2 ± 0.49 mg/dl (range 1.4-10.4), magnesemia 2 ± 0, 49 mg/dl (range 1.6-2.5), GOT 70 ± 27.7 mg/dl (range 4-37), GPT 150 ± 89.4 mg/dl (range 10-50), alkaline phosphatase 291 ± 163.5 mg/dl (range 80-300). After 7 and a half months at home on TPN, the patient with a BMI = 18.63 and a prealbumin of 32.9 mg/dl (range 20-40), underwent bowel reconstruction, progressed favourably and TPN was discontinued after 9 days.   "
"A 34-year-old woman, of Argentinean nationality, referred from Neuropaediatrics to the Metabolic Diseases Unit of the Hospital Ramón y Cajal, in order to rule out metabolic disease, because she had two children aged 12 and 9 years, from different fathers, with microcephaly and severe mental retardation. The patient reported having had another child who, due to cardiac malformation, died at 3 months of age. She was married, spoke normally and performed activities of daily living. She sometimes had problems with money exchange and had not been able to complete her studies but could read, write, add, subtract, multiply and divide (only by 1 digit). His IQ was estimated at 70-75, corresponding to mild-moderate mental retardation. He was not undergoing any treatment or reported any known illnesses and had no family history of interest. In both children, Phe levels were normal, 70 and 92 micromol/L. However, Phe levels were determined in the patient and were 1,140 micromol/L (normal < 120 micromol/L). Phe levels at diagnosis, between 660 and 1,200 micromol/L, condition a classification of mild-moderate PKU phenotype. Differential diagnosis was made with disorders of pterin metabolism, which were found to be normal. The following mutational changes were found in the PAH gene: c.165delT (p.Phe55fs) / c.q62G > A (p.Val388Met), with both children being carriers of the p.Phe55fs mutation only. After the diagnosis of phenylketonuria in the mother, an overload of Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) was performed to discover a possible response to this pharmacological treatment, since in some PKU patients it is possible to improve PAH activity by giving pharmacological doses of its cofactor, but in this patient the phenylalanine levels did not undergo significant changes and therefore she was considered a non-responder.  Treatment was started with a diet limited in phenylalanine in order to maintain phenylalanine levels below 660 micromol/L (maximum levels allowed in adults without pregnancy) and weekly control of phenylalanine in blood. To this end, we adjusted the diet to 20-25 g of high biological value proteins/day (PAVB: milk, eggs, meat, fish, cheese, cereals and pulses) divided into breakfast, lunch and dinner (5-10 and 10 g), with freedom in vegetables, natural fruit, peeled potatoes, olives, sugar, oils, butter, corn starch (Maizena®), spices and low-protein foods Loprofín®, Aglutella® and Aproten® purchased through the Association of PKU patients in Madrid. To the PAVB were added 60 g of special proteins without phenylalanine (PrXPhe) distributed in 4 intakes/day, in the form of special preparations containing essential amino acids without phenylalanine with carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, ions, oligoelements and vitamins. The weekly evolution of the Phe levels during the first 3 months of follow-up showed levels of 498 ± 15 micromoles/L. Subsequently the family returned to Argentina where they are currently undergoing treatment.   "
"A 78-year-old woman, weighing 40 kg and 1.65 m tall, with a history of gastrectomy for gastric ulcer with Billroth II reconstruction more than 30 years ago, which was subsequently converted to Roux-en-Y due to alkaline reflux. One year later, he began to suffer from subocclusive symptoms, requiring surgery for intestinal obstruction. Secondary malnutrition with severe hypoalbuminaemia, severe chronic anaemia, pressure ulcers in the sacral region and heels, urinary incontinence and immobility syndrome. He also had renal TB more than 20 years ago, with repeated pyelonephritis, which required surgery due to ureteral stenosis. He was admitted for anaemia with a haemoglobin of 4.8 g/dl (VN: 12-18 g/dl) secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented severe protein-calorie malnutrition (BMI: 14.7 kg/m2), with albumin of 2.48 g/dl (VN: 3.30-5.20 g/dl). On admission she had a urinary catheter with urine in a purple collection bag. Three months earlier, she had been admitted for anasarca symptoms related to malnutrition due to malabsorptive syndrome, and at that time she was started on hypercaloric/hyperproteic nutritional supplements (Fortimel® 1 every 8 hours). Table I shows the improvement in the biochemical nutritional markers from this first admission and the start of the nutritional supplements until discharge from hospital. During the first admission, the patient required bladder catheterisation for diuresis control, which was subsequently maintained to promote healing of the ulcers in the sacral region. Shortly before discharge, purple urine was observed in the bladder catheter bag, so fosfomycin was empirically administered in a long regimen due to suspicion of urinary tract infection. On admission, the persistence of the purple colour of the urine in the bladder catheter bag was observed despite antibiotic treatment. The patient describes having noticed this change in colour since previous discharge and that it persists when the catheter is changed, reappearing three or four days after each change. She did not present fever or leukocytosis at any time. The biochemical analysis of the urine shows an alkaline pH (8.5), which can also be observed in the analyses of previous months. In addition, the sediment shows magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals, 10-25 red blood cells per field, 10-25 leukocytes per field and abundant bacteriuria. The nitrite reaction was negative. Urine culture isolated Proteus vulgaris, resistant to fosfomycin. Treatment was started with ciprofloxacin (sensitive according to the antibiogram) and the bladder catheter was changed. After 48 hours the urine was normal in colour.   "
"A 39-year-old patient with a personal history of type 2 diabetes mellitus of 3 years' evolution with poor metabolic control, thrombophilia due to mutation of the prothrombin gene, super-morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] 52 kg/m2) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). She had been under follow-up in endocrinology consultations since the diagnosis of her diabetes. As treatment, she had been recommended diet and regular physical exercise, premixed insulin in 2 doses, metformin, omega-3 fatty acids, fenofibrate, mesalazine and omeprazole. The patient went to a private clinic for bariatric surgery, where she underwent laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion without cholecystectomy one month after the last flare-up of her UC, and the postoperative period was uneventful. The patient required hospital admission 10 months after surgery due to oedematisation of the lower limbs secondary to protein malnutrition and aggravated by acute gastroenteritis. She was admitted to our care again one month later from the outpatient department for persistent severe hypoalbuminaemia. Since the surgery, she had not presented any outbreak of UC. He reported 2-3 semi-soft stools and denied vomiting or food intolerances. He had discontinued his antidiabetic treatment and was in remission according to the American Diabetes Association. On physical examination, general condition was acceptable with mucocutaneous pallor, blood pressure 99/62, heart rate 57 beats/minute, weight 63 kg (percentage of overweight lost 92.4%), height 1.61 m and BMI 24.32 kg/m2. Lower extremities with oedema with fovea up to the knees. Laboratory tests on admission showed total protein: 4.4 g/dl (Normal Range [NR] 6.4-8.3); albumin: 1.4 g/dl (NR 3.4-5.0) and prealbumin of 5 mg/dl (NR 20-40). He also presented anaemia without iron deficiency with a haemoglobin of 9.8 g/dl (NR 12.0-18.0). With a diagnosis of severe calorie-protein malnutrition, treatment was started with a high-calorie, high-protein diet, in addition to the administration of protein powder modules (60 grams per day). During her hospital stay, which lasted 3 weeks, the patient evolved favourably, remaining stable and with disappearance of oedema. At discharge, the patient was in good general condition and showed analytical improvement in nutritional parameters. Bone densitometry performed during her admission was normal.   "
"A 51-year-old man with ileocolic Crohn's disease of long evolution, with multiple complications due to flares, who required intestinal resection surgery and was left with a terminal ileostomy in 2009. This year NPD was started using a fully implanted intravascular device. He was being treated with Infliximab and corticosteroids. The following year he was admitted on several occasions for febrile syndrome associated with abdominal pain, without an obvious source and the disease itself was considered to be the origin. During these hospitalisations, Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in several blood cultures. The catheter was also replaced due to breakage, removing only the reservoir and the proximal portion of the catheter as the distal portion was fixed to the tissue, so that a fragment remained lodged inside the superior vena cava. In February 2011, she presented with a similar condition with fever for 11 days and abdominal pain that progressed to septic shock and she was admitted to the ICU. A chest X-ray showed that the abandoned fragment of the catheter was located from the superior vena cava to the right ventricle. The study was completed with an echocardiogram which showed vegetations over the catheter protruding from the atrium into the ventricle. With the diagnosis of catheter endocarditis, antibiotic treatment with Daptomycin and Rifampicin was started, taking into account previous isolations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and cardiac surgery was performed to remove both catheters.  Initially the patient developed multi-organ dysfunction with no control of the septic picture despite antibiotic treatment. A cranial and thoraco-abdominal CT scan was performed to look for other foci of infection with the following findings: subarachnoid haemorrhage, patchy condensations in the right lung and several splenic infarctions, all compatible with multiple septic emboli. Several isolates were found in the surgical specimen: Staphylococcus epidermidis in the functioning catheter and polymicrobial growth in the catheter with vegetation. In this case, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Ochrobactrum anthropi and a fungus identified at the National Microbiology Centre in Majadahonda as Trichorderma longibrachiatum were isolated. With these results, the antibiotic treatment was modified to Linezolid, Imipenem and Caspofungin, and the septic picture was finally controlled. The patient had a torpid evolution with the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy, pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation due to Acinetobacter baumannii and polyneuropathy of the critical patient. After an ICU stay of 45 days, all these processes were resolved and he was transferred to the ward where he completed his recovery.   "
"A 73-year-old man diagnosed with infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx G1, cT4b cN2, undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy until 3 months previously. He presented dysphagia secondary to radiotherapy for both solids and liquids, with a weight loss of 10 kilograms (kg) in two months. She received enteral nutrition through NGUS for two years, and was finally scheduled for PEG. During oral endoscopy, bleeding occurred during dilation of a stricture in the upper oesophageal portion, so the procedure was abandoned and the patient underwent RPG, which was performed without incident.   "
"A 47-year-old man, referred to us from the Rehabilitation Department in February 2011, for assessment of his obesity. The patient had a personal history of spinal cord injury following an accident at work in 2004, with vertebral fracture and incomplete paraplegia at L1. He smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day and had arterial hypertension treated with enalapril 20/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 every 24 hours and untreated hypertriglyceridaemia. In the directed anamnesis, he reported great difficulty in daily life (he needs a wheelchair to get around and uses a standing position for transfers). She recognised that she had a strong appetite and snacking between meals. Since 2006 she had tried several times to lose weight, without success. On examination she weighed 135 kg and was 1.72 cm tall, BMI 46.62 kg/m2. tA 145/92. His blood tests showed cholesterol 222 mg/dL and triglycerides 260 mg/dL with HDL cholesterol 41 mg/dL. After being assessed by the multidisciplinary team at our hospital, and ruling out contraindications for surgery, his case was approved and he underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in January 2014. One month after surgery the patient is doing well, had no complications in the immediate postoperative period; and denies vomiting at present. He has less appetite and is on a fractional liquid diet. His current weight is 120 kg. From the point of view of her cormobilities, she has stopped hypotensive treatment and her BP control at home is optimal (110/90). Analytically, she has no vitamin deficiency, with daily supplementation of a vitamin complex.   "
"A 61-year-old Caucasian woman, diagnosed 13 years previously, by transbronchial lung biopsy, with IPF. The patient had been treated with corticosteroids up to two years earlier. She had been receiving continuous home oxygen therapy for 20 months. Six years earlier she had been diagnosed with duodenal ulcus and had no other history of interest. In the week prior to her admission she presented with frequent and severe coughing attacks, without expectoration, fever or increase in her usual dyspnoea. On the day of admission, she presented to the emergency department with sudden swelling in the left cervical region, intermittent central thoracic pain, which increased with coughing and respiratory movements, and dyspnoea at rest. Physical examination revealed tachypnoea (32 breaths/minute), tachycardia (120 beats/minute), swelling and crackles in the left cervical region, fine crackles in both lung fields and crackles on cardiac auscultation (Hamman's sign), with no paradoxical pulse. The most relevant analytical data were: leucocytes 23.9x109/l (80% neutrophils), haemoglobin 132 g/l, haematocrit 39.4%, LDH 342 U/l and creatine kinase 123 U/l. Baseline arterial blood gas values were: pH 7.47, PO2 54 torr, PCO2 36 torr, HCO3- 27.1 mmol/l and oxygen saturation 90%. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 120 beats per minute, the rest of the tracing being normal. A neck X-ray showed cervical emphysema predominantly on the left. A chest X-ray revealed a bilateral pulmonary fibrosis pattern more marked in the lower fields, with an anterior pneumomediastinum evident in the lateral projection. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a marked pattern of bilateral pulmonary fibrosis, a pneumomediastinum and large air bullae in the left upper lobe, with no evidence of pneumothorax.  The evolution was favourable with symptomatic treatment, with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum disappearing after 14 days in radiological controls.  "
"A 38-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease of 3 years' evolution and admitted on two occasions for episodes of intestinal obstruction that were treated medically without the need for surgery. Since his last admission, 6 months earlier, the patient had remained asymptomatic and two weeks before admission, the patient consulted his GP for fever and diarrhoea and was thought to be suffering from an exacerbation of Crohn's disease, receiving treatment with corticosteroids without objective improvement. Given the persistence of fever, he attended the emergency department with chills, vomiting, anorexia and pain in the right hypochondrium. On examination, the patient was febrile (39°C) with poor general condition, and a distended and painful abdomen in the right hypochondrium but without hepatomegaly. Cardiopulmonary examination was normal. The haemogram showed leukocytosis of 26,500/mm3 with a left shift, haemoglobin 10.6 g/l, haematocrit 36.3%, platelets 490,000 and sedimentation rate of 50 mm/h. Serum biochemistry showed normal levels of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and urea. Chest X-ray was normal. Abdominal CT revealed multiple abscesses in the right hepatic lobe. No other abdominal abscesses or abnormalities of the gallbladder, bile duct or pancreas were identified. Empirical intravenous treatment with Gentamicin 80 mg every 8 hours and Clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours was started. Before definitive treatment of the abscess, a detailed study was performed to identify the cause of the liver abscess. On colonoscopy, no abnormalities were observed and radiological evaluation of the small bowel revealed several strictures at the level of the jejunum and ileum but no evidence of fistulae or intestinal obstruction.  The liver abscess was drained under ultrasound control, and samples of the abscess contents were taken for culture where Streptococcus milleri grew. Blood cultures were sterile. Intravenous antibiotherapy was continued for 6 weeks. Drainage was maintained for 21 days and removed when drainage was minimal. His recovery was satisfactory, and he was discharged after completion of antibiotic treatment. An abdominal CT scan performed 4 months later showed collapse of the abscess cavities.  "
"We present the case of a 26-year-old woman, with no previous history of interest, who, although previously well, began with mild odynophagia, an afternoon fever of up to 38.5º which resolved well with paracetamol, and general malaise. No accompanying chills or sweating crises. 4-5 days later, she noticed the appearance of lymph nodes in both laterocervical areas and started treatment with amoxicillin, 500 mg/8 h, on her own without observing any improvement. Physical examination revealed the presence of lymph nodes in both laterocervical chains, of medium consistency, rolling, non-adherent, 1-2 cm in diameter and painless. There were no palpable lymphadenopathies at other levels or organomegaly. No goitre or pain on pressure over the thyroid region. The analytical study showed leukocytosis with lymphocyte predominance, with an ESR of 22 mm/h. Liver function was preserved, there was no hypergammaglobulinaemia and mantoux was negative. Chest X-ray was normal. Serology for the viruses studied was negative (anti-EBV, CMV, HIV, HTLV-1, HV-6, toxoplasma and syphilis). In the immunological study: ANA: 1/40 (80), antiDNA: 13.4 IU/ml (50), antiRNA: negative, ENA-RNP: 0.45 and anticardiolipin: negative. Thyroid function was assessed: T3: 1.31 mg/L (0.6-1.6), T4: 84 mg/L (46-93), TSH: 6.3 mU/L (<7), TGB (antithyroglobulin): 20.17 U/mL (<60), TPO (antiperoxidase): 1071 U/mL. Thyroid scan was normal. The fever disappeared after 12 days, but the lymph nodes remained unchanged, so a biopsy of two lymph nodes in the middle area of the right latero-cervical chain was performed, which was diagnostic. Histological examination was compatible with non-lymphocytic histiocytic necrotising lymphadenitis or Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. In the evolutionary control of thyroid function 5 months after the onset of the disease, a decrease in the titre of antithyroid antibodies was observed (TGB: 7.6 U/mL; TPO: 870 U/mL), maintaining normal thyroid hormone and TSH levels (2.95 mU/L). Our diagnosis was subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis associated with Kikuchi's disease.   "
"The patient was a 29-year-old man with a history of two admissions for febrile syndrome in the last two years. On one occasion, in June 1999, he was diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis with positive serology for EBV (positive VCA IgG, VCA IgM and EBNA). On the other, in September 2000, after presenting with a 10-day clinical picture of fever with chills, asthenia and general malaise with persistent positive serology for EBV, and an abdominal ultrasound scan revealed splenomegaly with a hypoechoic lesion which, after responding favourably to antibiotic treatment (broad-spectrum coverage), he was discharged with a diagnosis of splenic abscess. Since then, he remained asymptomatic until he was readmitted in June 2001 with a fever of one week's duration, accompanied by chills, headache, odynophagia and weight loss, with no other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 39ºC, general malaise, cutaneous and mucosal pallor and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests showed normocytic anaemia (Hb 11.9 g/dl, Ht 35.8% and MCV 91.8 fl), thrombopenia (44,000 platelets/mm3), normal white blood cells (7,440/mm3) with neutrophilia (77%) and left deviation (7%Cay), slightly elevated transaminases (GPT 48 IU/L) and cholestasis enzymes (GGT 88 IU/L, FA 232 IU/L). The rest of the biochemical parameters, the coagulation study and the elemental urinalysis were normal. Proteinogram, immunoglobulin determination and immunological study were normal. Various microbiological studies were performed, including serology for hepatitis viruses (A, B and C), retroviruses (HIV-1 and 2), typhoid, brucella, mycoplasma, legionella (with determination of urine antigen), herpes, CMV, and toxoplasma, which were negative. The results of EBV serology were IgG anti-VCA IgG and IgG anti-EBNA positive and IgM anti-VCA negative. The rest of the microbiological studies (blood cultures, sputum cultures and urine cultures, which included the study of mycobacteria) were negative. Imaging tests, specifically the abdominal CT scan, showed a focal splenic lesion (which was related to abscess or infarction), enlarged lymph nodes at the para-aortic level and mesenteric adenopathies. In other studies, the results (microbiological and histopathological) obtained from liver and bone marrow biopsy were negative. Given the initial diagnostic suspicion of intra-abdominal abscess, antibiotic treatment was started with ceftazidime, metronidazole and vancomycin, with a slight clinical improvement. Subsequently, given the aforementioned history and clinical picture, and in order to rule out, among other diagnostic possibilities, a lymphoproliferative process, a diagnostic laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia. In this intervention, a significant splenomegaly, focal thickening of the hepatic capsule of the left hepatic lobe, a small peritoneal nodule in the mesentery of the distal ileum and multiple small lymphadenopathies at the same level were found, samples were obtained from all of them and a splenectomy was performed. Histological study of the lymph nodes indicated reactive lymphadenitis in the lymph nodes, calcified granuloma in the peritoneal nodule and no relevant findings in the sample from the left hepatic lobe. The splenectomy specimen, which weighed 442 grams and measured 15 x 11 cm in greatest diameter, had a subcapsular nodule of 2 cm in greatest diameter, homogeneous and whitish. The remaining splenic tissue was congestive in appearance and showed no pathology. Microscopic analysis revealed a proliferation of spindle and myofibroblastic cells, with positive immunohistochemical studies for actin and negative for ALK 1 and EBV, and the pathological diagnosis was inflammatory pseudotumour of the spleen. The patient evolved favourably and has remained asymptomatic ever since.   "
"A 27-year-old woman, active polydrug addict, who 15 days before admission started with a dry cough, dyspnoea of progressive intensity, fever, asthenia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. She had a history of recently diagnosed HIV infection, with unknown immunological and virological parameters. Examination on admission showed cachexia, 40 breaths/min, 120 beats/min. BP: 110/60 mm Hg, thrush, acropacities, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy less than 1 cm and right supraclavicular 2 cm. Generalised decrease in vesicular murmur and bibasal crackles, systolic murmur II/VI polyfocal, hepatomegaly 2 cm from the costal border and vulvar condylomas. The rest of the somatic and neurological examinations were normal. The following complementary tests were performed on admission: Hb 11.3 g/dL, 6,900 leukocytes/µL (79% segmented, 14% lymphocytes), 682,000 platelets/µL; sodium 119 mmol/L, LDH 603 IU/L, the rest of the autoanalyser values were normal. Baseline arterial blood gases on admission: pH 7.54, pCO2 34.8 mm Hg, pO2 73.4 mm Hg. Chest X-ray showed a right anterior mediastinal mass compressing and displacing the trachea and a bilateral alveolar-interstitial infiltrate. Subsequently, abdominal ultrasound and thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT scans were performed, showing bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies smaller than one cm, a large mediastinal mass compressing the trachea and superior vena cava, a resolving pulmonary interstitial pattern and thickening of the wall of the intestinal loops with a small amount of free fluid between them. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and no abnormalities were found. Treatment was started with cotrimoxazole, levofloxacin and amphotericin-B, despite which he developed progressive respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Over the following days, the respiratory failure improved and mechanical ventilation was withdrawn. Subsequently, he presented with a generalised tonic-clonic seizure followed by left hemiparesis; a cranial CT and MRI scan was performed, showing a thick-walled mass with a hypodense centre measuring 4 cm in diameter at the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction. Sulphadiazine, pyrimethamine, folic acid and phenytoin were added to the treatment, which was withdrawn three weeks later due to lack of clinical improvement and reduction of the intracranial lesion. FNA and biopsy of supraclavicular adenopathy were performed and reported as metastasis of undifferentiated malignant tumour of epithelial origin. Later the following results were received: CD4+ lymphocytes: 440/mL, HIV viral load: 25,000 copies/mL, normal alpha-fetoprotein and b-HCG: 650 mIU/mL (normal < 5). Microbiological studies on blood, urine, sputum, brocoaspirate and lymph node puncture were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. Staining of respiratory samples was negative for P. carinii (P. jiroveci). Serologies for Toxoplasma, hepatotropic viruses and RPR were negative; cryptococcal antigen was negative.  Diagnosis and evolution: Initially the diagnosis was made of diffuse pneumonia presumably due to P. carinii (P. jiroveci) and probable disseminated lymphoma with mediastinal, cerebral and intestinal involvement. After receiving the results of the lymph node biopsy and tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein and ß-HCG), the definitive diagnosis was made: extragonadal germ cell tumour with supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph node involvement, and probably cerebral. It was suggested that the patient undergo a tumour extension study and start treatment with polychemotherapy, which she refused, despite being told that the high chemosensitivity of the tumour made it potentially curable. The patient died in another centre several weeks after discharge.  "
"A 60-year-old male patient with a Björk-Shilley type mitral metal prosthesis and tricuspid annuloplasty 20 years earlier due to rheumatic valve disease, chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), AHT, congestive heart failure (CHF) with a NYHA Functional Grade I/IV. He was receiving treatment with acenocoumarol. He was admitted to our department due to fever, chills, and worsening of his usual dyspnoea, with the appearance of orthopnoea and oedema in the lower limbs. The clinical examination was compatible with CHF (jugular veins ingurgitated, arrhythmic pulse at 100 bpm, gallop rhythm, bilateral basal pulmonary crackles, hepatomegaly of 2 crossings with positive hepatojugular reflex and pretibial oedema with fovea in MMII). Blood tests showed haemoglobin 12.4 g/L, leukocytes 17,810/ml, with 87% neutrophils, the rest of the usual parameters being within the normal range. Chest X-ray showed signs of CHF. Serial blood cultures were performed in which Neisseria Sicca was persistently isolated, so treatment was started with intravenous Penicillin G sodium 24 million units in continuous perfusion and Gentamicin 80 mg I.V. every 8 hours (first 2 weeks), and the patient was afebrile on the third day of starting treatment. During admission, reddish, painful lesions appeared on the fingertips of both hands compatible with vasculitic phenomena, and a diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis (IE) was made according to Durack's clinical criteria (4). Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) showed a normofunctioning mitral prosthesis and absence of vegetations. On the 9th day of treatment, the patient presented an abrupt episode of loss of strength in the left hemibody, and a cranial CT scan showed 3 hyperdense images at the temporal-parietal and occipital levels of both hemispheres compatible with haemorrhagic foci. At that time, the NRI was 2.45, in spite of which anticoagulation was suspended. Four days later, and after stabilisation of the patient, it was decided to restart anticoagulation with iv sodium heparin, completing 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment and heparin. In the follow-up CT scan of the brain after treatment, the occipitoparietal haematoma persisted, the other haemorrhagic foci having disappeared. Given these findings and the possibility of rebleeding, the patient was discharged with bemiparin 10,000 I.U. subcutaneously once a day for 3 months, after which a new echocardiographic study and cranial CT scan were performed, which showed the normality of the mitral valve and the practical resolution of the cerebral haematoma, for which reason oral anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was started again, and three months later he was found to be asymptomatic.  "
"A 62-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension (AHT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on treatment with metformin, who began 24 hours prior to admission with general malaise, fever up to 38.5 ºC, back pain and acute confusional symptoms, together with progressive loss of vision in the right eye. On examination, the patient was confused, sleepy, febrile, with blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg and 95 bpm. From the ophthalmological point of view, she presented upper eyelid oedema in the right eye with ptosis of mechanical appearance, restriction to elevation and adduction due to orbital oedema, conjunctival chemosis, transparent cornea, with the ability to perceive light and project focus, with myotic pupil with the appearance of synechiae, and an unexplorable fundus due to opacity of the media. The rest of the general examination was normal. Blood tests showed haemoglobin 10.5 g/dL, 82,000 platelets/µL, 5020 leukocytes/µL, with 82% neutrophils, glucose 402 mg/dL, glomerular sedimentation rate 133 mm in the first hour, and a C-reactive protein of 165 U/L. All other routine laboratory parameters were within normal limits. In urine, 30-40 leucocytes/field were observed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 95 cells/mm3, with 84% polymorphonuclear and 16% mononuclear, 77 mg/dl glucose and 125 mg/dl protein. A CAT scan and cranial MRI were performed, where no orbital or cavernous sinus alterations were observed. A spinal MRI showed an image compatible with spondylitis at L4-L5 level. A transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram did not reveal endocarditis. Blood cultures, urine cultures and CSF cultures were performed, and Escherichia coli was isolated in all of them, with the same sensitivity pattern in the antibiogram. She received treatment with ceftriaxone 2 g i.v. and ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. twice daily, together with topical treatment with neomycin, prednisone and atropine for 30 days, continuing with oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily for 14 more days. At the end of treatment, the affected eye retained the ability to perceive light.  "
"Patient aged 76 years, with a history of thalassaemia minor, type 2 diabetes mellitus, adequately controlled with low doses of oral antidiabetics (Hb 1AC 6.8). He had an appendectomy in his youth and a testicular hydrocele surgery. The patient was admitted due to a 15-year history of incapacitating syncope and orthostatic syncope, which had even functionally limited him in recent years, to the point of preventing him from going out in the street. He was partially studied for this reason in 1996. In this study, a complete paroxysmal AV block was found, which was initially interpreted as the cause of the symptoms, so that a VDD pacemaker was inserted without the patient's symptoms having completely subsided. It was decided to extend the study at the time, and an echocardiogram was performed, which except for a slight hypertrophy of the left ventricle showed no other alterations, as well as an abdominal CT scan, which was normal. The neurological examination was normal at the time. The patient was discharged with the diagnosis of idiopathic orthostatic syncope, and treatment was started with etilefrin, spironolactone and fludocortisone. The patient, however, did not improve his symptoms, presenting syncope on orthostasis almost daily, with frequent trauma, together with a state of presyncope maintained while the patient remained seated. Given the incapacitating symptoms, it was decided to admit the patient to complete the study and adjust the treatment. In the anamnesis, in addition to the syncope, the patient only reported nocturia 4-5 times a day, and diarrhoea of 4-5 abundant watery stools, without pathological products, of about ten years of evolution, not accompanied by weight loss or toxic symptoms. The anamnesis by organs and apparatus was negative. Physical examination revealed a significant drop in BP on sitting compared to lying down, from around 120/80 mm Hg to 60/40 mm Hg, with no other manifestations other than an intense pre-syncopal sensation. During these episodes, the patient had no sweating or compensatory tachycardia. Physical examination only showed some behavioural disinhibition of the patient, not accompanied by signs of frontal release. The rest of the neurological and general examination was normal. The following complementary tests were performed for the study of the patient: biochemistry: glucose 127; cre 1.16; total proteins 7; albumin 3.78; calcium 9.9; phosphorus 2.9; uric acid 8; cholesterol 125; triglycerides 174; sodium 140; potassium 4.76. CBC: leukocytes 6,740 (normal formula); red blood cells 4.34; Hb 9.7; MCV 68.7; platelets 169,000. Liver profile: normal. Vitamin B12 levels 925 and folic acid 16. Hormonal study: prolactin 10.4; FSH 9.2; LH 7.3; testosterone 277; night cortisol 9; basal cortisol 38; rhythm cortisol 76%; total porphyrins < 200; aldolase 3. Electrophoretic spectrum: albumin 53.8%; alpha1 3.3%; alpha2 15.3%; beta 13.7%; gamma 13.9%. Blood in stool: negative. Cranial CT scan: The study showed signs of diffuse atrophy in relation to the patient's age, with no other relevant findings. Colonoscopy: No lesions were seen in the areas visualised. Biopsies were taken from the proximal descending colon to rule out macroscopic colitis. Small diverticular orifices throughout the colon. Biopsy of colorectal mucosa: usual characteristics. Specific staining for amyloid was performed and was negative. Echocardiogram: hypertrophic left ventricle with systolic function at low limits of normality with slight global hypokinesia. Mild mitral insufficiency. No evidence of amyloidosis. Arrhythmological study: VDD pacemaker with single lead, normofunctioning. The pacing rate was reduced without obtaining ventricular rhythm (complete AV block with ventricular pacing at 40 bpm). Cold pressure test: BP with the patient in decubitus position 112/68. After 30"" with hand on ice: BP 108/56. HIV serology: Negative. Chest X-ray: No significant findings. Abdominopelvic CT scan: No significant lesions. Plasma catecholamine levels in decubitus and seated position: low basal levels, without the expected elevation in seated position. Urine catecholamine levels: low. Given the normality of the complementary tests, the diagnosis of pure autonomic failure is established, withdrawing the hypotensive drugs from the treatment, maintaining only etilefrine and fludocortisone, together with symptomatic measures, subjectively improving the patient.  "
"The patient was a 27-year-old man who had suffered from pneumonia as a child and was a non-smoker and non-smoker. He was diagnosed with extrinsic bronchial asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with hypersensitivity to grasses and olive trees. He needed inhaled corticosteroids sporadically. After significant physical exertion (he was a costalero in a procession during a local festival and had slept very little) in the summer of 2003, he began to experience pain in the right hemithorax that sometimes radiated to the right upper limb and increased with deep breathing. Subsequently, he developed a fever and a feeling of dyspnoea, for which he went to the hospital emergency department. Clinical examination on admission revealed a poor general condition and a lesion in the scar phase on the abdominal wall that could correspond to a boil. Vesicular murmur was diminished at the right base. Cardiac and neurological examinations were normal. There were no organomegalies. There was leukocytosis (from 12,000/cubic mm to 18,700/cubic mm) with neutrophilia, the rest of the haematological parameters being within normal limits. There was no eosinophilia. Creatinine increased during admission to 1.6 mg/dl and urea to 61 mg/dl. Other biochemical values were: total bilirubin: 2.19 mg/dl, direct fraction: 1.33 mg/dl, LDH: 687 IU/l, GOT: 61 IU/l; GPT: 111 IU/l, GGT: 521 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 509 IU/l. Sedimentation rate reached 71 mm in the first hour. Serology for HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Serial blood cultures were performed and were positive for susceptible Staphylococcus aureus methicillin. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal images without pericardial effusion. Ten days after admission, a warm, erythematous lesion appeared in the right parasternal region that disappeared on digitopressure and was about 5 x 5 cm. Fluid was aspirated from the lesion, the culture of which was also positive for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. Chest CT scan showed a left pleural effusion with interstitial prominence. There were three small nodular images in the right upper lobe, left upper lobe and another subpleural image of less than one centimetre in size compatible with small staphylococcal abscesses (Fig. 1). The CT scan of the abdomen was normal, with no presence of adenopathy or fluid in the free cavity. The bone scan showed intensely increased osteogenic activity at the level of the sternal joint compatible with arthritis at that level. An MRI of the sternum was performed. There was gadolinium uptake at the joint of the manubrium with the sternal body, extending to the middle of the manubrium and the proximal third of the sternal body, with enlargement and uptake in the adjacent soft tissues, both anterior and posterior. These findings were compatible with arthritis at that level and highly suggestive of osteomyelitis. There were no signs of bone destruction. The clinical course was good with antibiotic treatment consisting of intravenous (IV) cloxacillin for 15 days at a dose of 2 g/6 hours and IV gentamicin for 7 days at a dose of 5 mg/kg/24 hours. He did not require intensive care at any time during his evolution. Subsequently, oral treatment with rifampicin (dose of 600 mg/24 h) and levofloxacin (dose of 500 mg, every 24 h) was continued for two months. The parasternal dermal lesion took five weeks to disappear. To rule out primary immunodeficiency, the patient underwent a screening test with the following results: normal complement levels, lymphocyte subpopulations and markers, granulocyte oxidative capacity and lymphocyte function (the latter with expression of activation markers in response to different stimuli). Protective levels for specific IgG against tetanus toxoid, Haemophilus By pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide. Slightly elevated levels of IgE and IgG4 with normality in the remaining immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgE = 170 IU/l, normal range: 0-100 IU/l; Ig G4 = 3,910 mg/l, normal range: 80-1,400 mg/l). Isohemagglutinin titres could not be assessed due to lack of samples. This study was performed when the patient was discharged and two months after the onset of the disease.   "
"We present the case of a 21-year-old male patient, with no known allergies or other history, who came to the emergency department for a 6-month clinical picture of asthenia, increased fatigue with moderate exercise and accompanied by a general syndrome with a weight loss of about 10 kg during these months. Due to episodes of abdominal pain during this period, he visited the emergency department twice and underwent gastroscopy, reported as minimal hiatus hernia with grade I oesophagitis and duodeno-gastric bile reflux. In the last 5 days, his symptoms worsened, with vomiting, more intense diffuse abdominal pain and liquid stools with no increase in the number of stools. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, heart rate of 110 pm, afebrile, conscious and oriented, without neurological focality, eupneic, cardiac auscultation was rhythmic, tachycardic, without murmurs, the abdomen was soft and depressible, diffusely painful, without defence on palpation, no masses or megaliths were palpated. There was generalised skin hyperpigmentation, accentuated in the nipples, genital area and with melanic spots on the palate and gingival borders. Blood tests on admission showed blood glucose 59 mg/dL, creatinine 4.32 mg/dL, urea 214 mg/dL, Na 123 mg/dL, K 8.0 mg/dL, Ca 8.2 mg/dL, arterial blood gas with pH 7.24, pCO2 35.6 mmHg, pO2 107 mmHg (with O2 at 4 litres/minute), bicarbonate 14.4 mmol/L, EB - 11.3 mmol/L and SatO2 97.2%. Haemoglobin 13.4 g/dl, haematocrit 39.5%, MCV 83 fL, leucocytes 12,800 (45% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, 12% monocytes and 10.5% eosinophils). Coagulation without alterations. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm with RSR' configuration and QT prolongation (487 ms). Chest X-ray was normal. During his stay in the ED, measures were initiated to correct the hyperkalaemia but the patient became progressively sweatier, tachycardic and hypotensive (BP 85/46 mmHg) and, with the suspicion of an Addisonian crisis, admission to the ICU was decided and volume replacement with saline was initiated (4. 500 cc in the first 24 hours), glucose, actocortin (100 mg i.v. bolus followed by 400 mg in continuous intravenous infusion in the following 24 hours); initially requiring vasopressor amine perfusion (dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min), which could be withdrawn in 36 hours. Blood samples taken prior to the start of corticosteroid treatment to determine adrenal function showed a basal cortisol 4.0 mg/dL and plasma ACTH 264 pg/ml. Determination of serum anti-adrenal capsule antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence was positive with a titre of 1/80. The determination of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, FSH and LH, as well as anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal peroxidase antibodies were within normal ranges. Abdominal CT: presence of morphologically normal adrenal glands. The patient was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit 3 days after admission and from the hospital 7 days later with renal function and ion parameters within normal range and with treatment with hydroaltresone 20 mg vo/8 h.  "
"A 79-year-old man, allergic to beta-lactams with a personal history of corticodependent COPD with several flare-ups a year and on treatment with home oxygen and bronchodilators at full doses (NYHA functional status III-IV). He came to the hospital with a 3-day history of cough with purulent expectoration, increased respiratory distress and worsening level of consciousness. Physical examination revealed fever of 38°C, central and peripheral cyanosis, increased jugular venous pressure, tachycardia at 120 bpm, prolonged expiratory time, wheezing and expiratory rhonchi in both lung fields, especially in the right lung. In the abdomen, painful hepatomegaly and oedema in both legs. Chest X-ray showed increased density in the right lower lobe, with poorly defined borders. The haemogram showed 22,970 leukocytes/mm3 (93N, 3.4L), Hb 13 g/dl, HCT 37%, MCV 90 fl, PLQ 235,000/mm3. Blood gas results were pH 7.45, pO257, pCO2 36.4, HCO3 25.9, SatO2 90%. Blood and sputum cultures were performed on general media (blood and chocolate agar, Biomerieux®) and for mycobacterial studies (Bactec 960 MGIT (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube) and Lowenstein (Becton Dickinson®)}. Gram and Ziehl stains of sputum did not provide diagnostic guidance. Sputum culture at 24 hours (intermediate quality, > 25 leukocytes 10-25 epithelial cells) showed only the usual respiratory tract flora. Empirical treatment was started with Levofloxacin iv. (500 mg/day), Vancomycin e.v. (1 g/12 h) and Tobacco (1 g/12 h). (1 g/12 h) and Tobramycin e.v. (200 mg/12 h). (200 mg/12 h). The patient developed a progressive clinical (hypotension, dyspnoea and fever) and analytical worsening (haemogram then showed 40,000 leukocytes/mm3), and died on the fourth day of admission.  On the same day of death, a positive blood culture and sputum culture were observed, both in specific medium for mycobacteria (MGIT). Ziehl's staining of both showed tangles of branched Ziehl's positive bacilli. From MGIT broth to Mueller-Hinton (Biomerieux®) and Lowenstein medium, dry colonies grew after 24 hours, initially whitish, but after 48 hours, they turned salmon-like, with a gypsum-like texture. The problem strain was sent to the National Microbiology Centre in Majadahonda. There, the 16S rDNA sequence of the microorganism was amplified by PCR and, with 100% homology, it was identified as Nocardia otitidiscaviarum.  "
"57-year-old patient with repeated hospital admissions for epigastralgia accompanied by minimal elevations of amylase. The patient was diagnosed with prostatic adenoma. He reported epigastric pain and abdominal distension during meals that forced him to stop eating. On three occasions the patient attended the emergency department. Only a slight elevation of amylase (155 IU, normal < 100) was observed. In an attempt to reach a diagnosis, a trancutaneous abdominal ultrasound, gastroscopy, colonoscopy and abdominal CT scan were performed. All tests were normal. Finally, a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed. Only the common bile duct and Wirsung's duodenum were found to lead separately into the duodenal wall. Initially it was interpreted as a variant of normality that can occur in up to 24% of normal subjects (1). However, given the disabling symptoms (the patient reported epigastralgia with almost every meal), it was suggested that an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) be performed. There was a history of allergy to iodinated contrasts, so glucocorticoid prophylaxis was performed. On endoscopic imaging the papilla had a flaccid appearance. The bile duct was deeply cannulated and a 0.025-inch guidewire was introduced to ensure access to the common bile duct. The introduction of contrast for cholangiopancreatography was performed from the same papillary orifice. During injection the papilla showed a distension visible on the endoscopic image and appeared as a cystic structure on cholangiography. The Wirsung was also drawn during the contrast injection but emptied immediately and was therefore not reflected on the radiographs. The diagnosis of choledochococele was made and it was sectioned by biliary sphincterotomy. The patient had no complications from the endoscopic intervention and the pain during swallowing has not reappeared after two years of follow-up.   "
"We present the clinical case of a 42 year old male, with no drug allergies, with a personal history of infectious mononucleosis in childhood, fracture of the left arm 5 years ago, morbid obesity with hepatic steatosis treated by bariatric surgery. He came to the Otorrolaryngology department for a few weeks of left nasal obstruction, with repeated episodes of purulent rhinorrhoea, with a sensation of left nasal packing, accompanied by an intranasal mass and a left submandibular tumour. Simultaneously, the patient was referred to the haematology department for repeated asymptomatic thrombocytosis in the blood tests. He was seen in the haematology department and, with the suspicion of essential thrombocythemia, a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy was performed, showing a platelet count of 487,000/ul in the haemogram. The patient underwent a biopsy of the intranasal mass, which was completed with an incisional biopsy of the left submandibular tumour. The cervico-facial CT scan showed a mass of soft tissue in the left submaxillary cell, with areas of necrosis or abscessation, 3 cm in greatest diameter; accompanied by an adjacent locoregional adenopathic component of probably inflammatory nature. There was also a second lesion in discontinuity with the previous one, corresponding to a left paralateronasal cyst. Biopsy of the intranasal lesion consisted of an infiltrate of lymphoid neoplastic cells with a diffuse growth pattern, no 'starry sky' images, and a moderate mitosis rate. The neoplastic cells are of intermediate size, with discretely irregular nuclei and moderate pleomorphism. The immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells determined by immunohistochemistry was: CD45+/cCD3+/Granzime B+/CD56+, CD20-/CD4-/CD8-/LMP1(EBV)-/Perforin-. Biopsy of the submandibular tumour showed massive infiltration by intermediate to large lymphoid neoplastic cells with nuclear irregularities and coarse, irregular and sparse azurophilic granulation. The immunophenotype is identical to that of the intranasal lesion. The EBER(EBV) determination was positive, there was polyclonal re-enhancer of T-lymphocyte receptor gamma chain (TCR) genes and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes. This was compatible with a diagnosis of extranodal nasal type NK lymphoma. The patient was immediately sent to the medical oncology department for evaluation. The patient was in very good general condition with a performance status of 0, with no B symptoms and asymptomatic, except for the symptoms of left nasal obstruction. The extension study was completed with thoraco-abdominal computed tomography, which showed no evidence of distant dissemination, bone marrow biopsy already requested due to suspicion of essential thrombocythemia, biochemistry with renal and hepatic profile, proteinogram, LDH and serum beta-2-microglobulin. Bone marrow examination showed normocellular parenchyma (3/5), with moderate megakaryocytic hyperplasia with elements in all maturational stages, some of them with hypertrophic appearance, with the remaining series preserved. There was no evidence of myelofibrosis, parasites or granulomas. There was also no lymphomatous infiltration. The bone marrow study does not support (nor does it absolutely rule out) the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. LDH and beta-2-microglobulin, as well as the rest of the biochemical parameters were in the normal range. Serology for HIV, HBV and HCV were negative. Haemoglobin and leukocyte counts were normal, with an unaltered leukocyte formula, with only a thrombocytosis of 487,000/ul standing out. With the diagnosis of extranodal NK lymphoma nasal type in localised stage with reactive thrombocytosis, the patient immediately started treatment with polychemotherapy followed by sequential radiotherapy, deciding to carry out an autologous bone marrow transplant as the first line of treatment.  "
"60-year-old male, smoker of 20 cigarettes/day, COPD (chronic bronchitis type). Herniated discs L4-L5-S1-S2 operated, biliary lithiasis with cholestasis pattern. Gastric adenocarcinoma (T3N1M0, IIIa) operated 4 years earlier by total gastrectomy + splenectomy + distal pancreatectomy + oesophago-jejunal and jejuno-jejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis, without subsequent chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Epigastralgia and frequent diarrhoea together with megaloblastic anaemia secondary to malabsorption. For 4 months she had been treated with phenytoin for epileptic seizures. Follow-up by the Oncology Department with no evidence of tumour recurrence, although she was being treated chronically with dexamethasone. She was admitted due to increased diarrhoea and a fever of 38ºC, with skin lesions on the lower limbs described as pustular and blistering, and signs of pneumonic consolidation in the D base confirmed by X-ray. The fever and pneumonic condensation disappeared after treatment with levofloxacin for two weeks. The abdominal pain, diarrhoea and heart rhythm disturbances also disappeared after treatment with digitalis, but the weakness of the lower limbs and skin lesions persisted, extending over the legs, arms, hands and back, predominantly erythematous, some with vesicles on the surface which, when ruptured, left a necrotic centre. Neither the imaging techniques performed (CT scan of the skull, thorax and abdomen and bone scintigraphy) nor the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed metastatic lesions or tumour infiltration. MRI of the spine revealed osteomalacia; decreased levels of 25-OH-D were observed. This osteomalacia could be explained by intestinal malabsorption of vitamin D, pancreatic insufficiency or treatment with anticonvulsants, three circumstances that occurred simultaneously in this patient. Blood culture, urine culture and stool culture were negative, as were HIV and CMV serology. For the diagnosis of the dermatological lesions, samples were taken for pathology and microbiology. The biopsy reported cells with foreign body inclusions suggestive of malignant disease or dermatophytosis. Microbiological examination confirmed dermatophytosis, with isolation of Trichophyton mentagrophytes in the culture of the sample taken from the hand lesions, and Alternaria sp in the culture of the sample taken from a lesion on the leg. Treatment with oral itraconazole was started with a very good clinical response, and the patient was discharged from hospital a few days later, although he was under review by the Dermatology and Internal Medicine Departments.   "
"An 18-year-old male patient attended the emergency department for severe headache and headache referred by his GP due to the lack of improvement with conventional treatment for viral upper respiratory infections. His personal history included only a history of infectious mononucleosis. After a week of catarrhal symptoms, with general malaise, dry cough and fever (up to 38.5 ºC), he developed a global headache, more intense at the frontal level, in the last 48 hours, initially without rhinorrhoea or nasal obstruction. Isolatedly, he presented minimal purulent nasal discharge that was occasionally bloody in the last few days. He did not present loss of consciousness, convulsions, shivering or chills. Physical examination revealed: temperature: 37.5ºC; BP: 137/73 mmHg; P: 71 bpm. Good general appearance with correct hydration and muco-cutaneous perfusion. No signs of illness. Febrile facies. No painful spots on percussion of the paranasal sinuses. On the skin there was a macular and erythematous rash affecting the trunk and neck. There were no palpable larynocervical, axillary or inguinal adenopathies. Cardiac auscultation was rhythmic, with no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation shows a preserved vesicular murmur, without the presence of rhonchi, crackles or wheezing. The abdomen is soft, depressible and there are no palpable masses or megaliths. The upper and lower extremities are free of pathological findings, with distal pulses present. The neurological examination was strictly normal, with no evidence of focality or meningismus. The corresponding complementary examinations were carried out, with a rigorously normal chest X-ray, non-pathological urine analysis and a haemogram showing leukocytosis with the presence of young forms (keys: 4%), making it necessary to consider the differential diagnosis between sinusitis and meningitis; therefore, a lumbar puncture was performed with 3 predominantly lymphoid cells and 0.3 g/dl of protein and no glucose consumption. At the same time, a radiographic study of the paranasal sinuses showed no data compatible with sinusitis; then, to rule out intracranial complications (such as cavernous sinus thrombosis / encephalitis), a cranial CT scan was performed, which showed occupation of the left sphenoid sinus, which was related to acute sinusopathy.  Once the diagnosis of sphenoidal sinusitis was confirmed, it was decided to admit the patient to hospital for proper monitoring of the patient's evolution and to start intravenous antibiotic treatment with third generation cephalosporins, treatment with which the patient evolved correctly, without complications, with the headache and fever subsiding within 48 hours and being asymptomatic at the time of discharge from hospital.   "
"The patient was a 40-year-old male of Bulgarian nationality with a personal history of gastro-oesophageal reflux and incompetent cardia, not previously operated on or transfused, employed as a metal carpenter, smoker of 15-20 cig/day and a moderate ex-drinker until 4 years ago. His family history included his mother, father and a brother with nephrolithiasis. He had been seen 21 days before admission for pain in the right flank with irradiation towards the ipsilateral testicle, which was classified as probable renal colic and treated with analgesia, with favourable evolution; he subsequently started again with similar symptoms accompanied by nausea without thermometric fever or micturition syndrome; he did not report loss of appetite or weight. He returned to the emergency department where an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed describing the presence of grade II/IV hydronephrosis and a 6-7 cm mass in the right reteroperitoneum, for which he was admitted for further study. The patient reported pain in the right renal flank/fossa radiating to the ipsilateral teste without nausea, vomiting or thermometric fever. Examination revealed only positive right renal suction. ECG in sinus rhythm at 76 bpm; chest X-ray with no significant pathological alterations. Blood tests showed fibrinogen 478 mg/dL (150-450), ESR21 mm/hour (2-15), urea 52 mg/dL (10-50), creatinine 1.4 mg/dL (0.6-1.2), LDH 446 U/L (0-288), human gonadotropinacorionic acid 7 UI/L (0-5) and alpha-fetoprotein 2.2 kU/L (0.5-7). An abdominopelvic CT scan was performed showing a single ""soft tissue"" mass of rounded morphology (7 x 5.5 cm) with a uniform density and a focal area of lesser attenuation that ""encompasses"" the inferior vena cava and the right ureter with grade 2 hydronephrosis; the lesion is well defined and no adenopathy or accompanying satellite lesions can be seen in the middle retroperitoneum (between the aorta and the inferior vena cava). Urgent referral was made to the Urology Department, which performed a right nephrostomy. A trucut biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass was performed under ultrasound guidance and the specimen was sent to anatomical pathology, which reported it as a neoformation consisting of large cells arranged in nests, with little cohesion and a cytoplasm of imprecise limits, generally finely vacuolated, The nuclei are rounded or cleaved, with a large nucleolus and the cells are arranged in nuclei and are surrounded by a large number of small lymphoid cells, corresponding to mature lymphocytes. The tumour cells are positive for C-Kit and are compatible with a classic seminoma-type germinal tumour. In view of this, a testicular ultrasound scan was performed, showing a 16 mm nodular-ovoid, isodense lesion with a peripheral hypodense halo, located in the upper half and subcapsular anteriorly, as well as another small hyperechoic nodule of approximately 5 mm, compatible with a right testicular tumour. He was subsequently referred to the Urology Department, after consultation with Oncology, to perform an orchiectomy and subsequently undergo chemotherapy cycles in the Oncology Department.   "
"We present the case of a 29-year-old man who came to our clinic with a case of one month's evolution consisting of a daily fever of 39º-40º, intense pleuritic pain in the left hemithorax and cough with abundant blackish expectoration. He had no medical or surgical history of interest. He had been a smoker of 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years. Physical examination was strictly normal, except for pulmonary auscultation in which there was an overall decrease in vesicular murmur with isolated areas of echophonia. Various analytical studies were performed, including: haemogram, general biochemistry, baseline arterial blood gases, creatinine clearance, calciuria, proteinogram, immunoglobulin and complement dosage, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, angiotensin-converting enzyme determination and biological markers, all results being normal. Spirometry showed a restrictive pattern. A pulmonary diffusion test showed decreased diffusion (65%), compatible with a reduction of the exchange surface. The plain chest X-ray showed a bilateral interstitial pattern. A chest CT scan showed multiple cystic lung lesions, none larger than 2 cm, distributed in both lungs, especially in the upper and middle lobes. A lytic lesion was also observed at the level of the left fourth costal arch. The Thoracic Surgery Department was asked to perform an open lung biopsy. Samples were taken from the upper and lower lobes of the left lung. The histopathological study showed infiltration of the lung parenchyma by eosinophils and mononuclear cells with aryronucleated nuclei typical of Langerhans cells. S-100 and CD1a immunohistochemical stains were positive. Electron microscopy was performed and the characteristic Langerhans cells with polylobed nuclei and deep indentations were observed. Structures formed by two double bet membranes were also seen, separated by a dense structure that fulfils the characteristics of a Birbeck granule in its tubular portion. With the diagnosis of LCPH, the patient was advised to stop smoking and an appointment was made for a follow-up chest CT scan at 6 months. In this study, the cystic lesions disappeared almost completely, with the costal lytic image persisting. Clinically, the patient showed a significant improvement and was asymptomatic except for the persistence of a slight costal pain in the left hemithorax that corresponded to the bony lesion observed in the CT scan.   "
"A 64-year-old man was transferred to the Internal Medicine Department from the Cardiology Department due to a fever of over 38.3 °C, of more than 3 weeks' evolution with no source of origin after 5 weeks of studies. On admission, the patient was being treated with gliclazide (1-1-1) and acarbose (1-1-1) to control type 2 diabetes mellitus, Atorvastatin (0-0-20 mg) to control hypercholesterolemia, quinapril (5 mg-0-5 mg) to control arterial hypertension and, finally, acetylsalicylic acid (0-150 mg-0) as vascular accident prophylaxis. In addition to these pathologies, the patient had severe aortic valve stenosis together with moderate aortic insufficiency, which required valve replacement with Mitroflow bioprosthesis no. 23 in March of the year of admission. When the patient was admitted to the Cardiology Department, a five-week febrile condition was detected in a patient with a prosthetic valve; a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out the presence of endocarditis or functional valvular alterations, and empirical intravenous treatment with Vancomycin was started (given the existence of a prosthetic valve despite not clearly demonstrating vegetation), improving until he was asymptomatic and afebrile when discharged from Cardiology a week later. During discharge, the patient underwent periodic body temperature controls, and 4 weeks later a new elevation was detected, which led him to our hospital and he was admitted for the second time to the Cardiology Department, where endocarditis was again ruled out by transesophageal echocardiography, so he was transferred to the Internal Medicine Department, with a diagnosis of Classical fever of unknown origin to be studied. After admission, fever of over 38.3°C, with peaks of up to 39°C, blood pressure of 150/70 mm of mercury, and a heart rate of 104 beats per minute were confirmed. On physical examination the patient was normal colour and normal depth, cardiac auscultation showed no murmurs, pulmonary auscultation showed preserved vesicular murmur with no evidence of rhonchi, crackles or wheezing; the abdomen was not painful and there was no evidence of splenomegaly; ENT examination showed no evidence of infectious foci; neurological examination showed no evidence of meningismus, strength or sensitivity deficit, or alteration of cranial nerves or osteotendinous reflexes; the examination also showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Complementary tests were performed for the study of fever of unknown origin according to protocol7 with a haemogram showing 14,000 leukocytes (70% neutrophils and 5% cayates) and 1371 g/dl haemoglobin. Biochemistry showed normal renal and hepatic function with normal glycaemia. A peripheral blood smear was performed which confirmed the haemogram data with no other pathological findings. Chest X-ray showed no pathological findings or changes with respect to previous admissions. A paranasal sinus X-ray showed hypoplasia of the left frontal sinus. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocarditis, abscesses or fistulas, together with a normofunctioning aortic prosthesis. Subsequently, a Ga67 scintigraphy was performed, with no tracer deposits in the thoracoabdominal region. To complete the study of fever of unknown origin, tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein, CEA-II, Ca 19.9n Ca 125II, BR 27.29, total PSA, Ca 15.3, specific neutrophil enolase, Ca 72. 4) which were normal and the study of immunological markers (ENA antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, ASLO, anti-DNA antibodies, ANCA, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, ANA and LKM) which were negative. On admission, blood cultures were taken after taking body temperature above 37.5 °C, and all four were positive for Leuconostoc spp. and the antibiogram showed sensitivity to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and tobramycin, antibiotherapy that was started from that moment onwards. Due to the existence of the bioprosthesis, the patient was treated for 8 weeks as if it were endocarditis, despite there being no evident lesions on transesophageal echocardiography. Periodic check-ups were carried out for 1 year after discharge without any febrile or clinical findings that would lead to any new suspicion of complications or valve complications.   "
"A 76-year-old woman with a history of ischaemic heart disease, diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis in 1992 due to chronic, symmetrical, erosive polyarthritis which fulfilled five of the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Chloroquine and parenteral methotrexate had been used as background medication. In 2000 she underwent total right knee arthroplasty with a satisfactory result. In 2002 she developed normocytic anaemia, fatigue, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy and splenomegaly. A haematological study revealed a monoclonal IgM component of 3.1 g/dl and after a bone marrow biopsy she was diagnosed with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Since the patient remained stable and oligosymptomatic with low doses of prednisone (7.5 mg/day) and oral methotrexate (7.5 mg/week), the haematology department decided to maintain a wait-and-see attitude, deferring therapy with alkylating agents or nucleoside analogues. During the first three days of August 2005, he presented with self-limited febrile diarrhoea. After a week's improvement, he began to experience fever, pain, swelling and progressive limitation of mobility in the right knee, symptoms that persisted and led to consultation and admission to our centre on 25 August. Examination revealed an axillary temperature of 37.5ºC, swelling and tension effusion in the right knee, patchy hypoaesthesia in the lower limbs and abolition of the Achilles reflexes. Arthrocentesis revealed a cream-coloured purulent fluid with 75,000 leukocytes/mm3 (> 95% polymorphonuclear). Gram stain failed to visualise microorganisms, but aerobic cultures recovered L. monocytogenes sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and rifampicin. ESR was 120 mm/1 hour. C-reactive protein: 51.7 mg/L. CBC showed 6.5 x 109 leukocytes/L (47% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 14% monocytes), Hb: 99 g/L, haematocrit: 28.7 L/L, platelets: 442 x 109/L. Immuglobulin levels: IgA (25 mg/dl), IgG (405 mg/dl), IgM (2300 mg/dl; VN < 230); light chains: lambda (44 mg/dl; VN: 90-210), kappa (276 mg/dl; VN 170-370). The following parameters were normal or negative: biochemistry (glucose, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, triglycerides, lacticodehydrogenase, creatinine kinase, transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium and chloride), urinalysis, serology for Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia, complement dosage (C3 and C4) and antinuclear antibodies. Rheumatoid factor by latex was 54 IU/ml. Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee showed periprosthetic radiolucencies. Abdominal ultrasound showed signs of hepatic steatosis and mild splenomegaly. In addition to drainage and saline lavage of the joint, 2 g of ampicillin every 6 h and gentamicin (3 mg/kg/8 hours; maintaining a concentration between 4 and 9 mg/ml) were administered intravenously for 5 weeks. At the time of writing this clinical note, three months after discharge from hospital, the patient is progressing favourably and is receiving treatment with co-trimoxazole and rifampicin, which will be continued for a total of 6 months.   "
"A 73-year-old woman with a personal history of bronchial asthma treated with bronchodilators on demand. She reported no cardiovascular risk factors. The patient came to the hospital with bronchial hyperresponsiveness secondary to respiratory infection. In the anamnesis she reported oppressive back pain with sweating and dyspnoea for 8 months, triggered by moderate exertion, which subsided with rest and had not changed during this time. Cardiac auscultation was rhythmic, with a third sound, a fluctuating systolic and diastolic murmur and signs of heart failure. Pulmonary auscultation revealed rhonchi and wheezing compatible with the bronchial hyperresponsiveness that led to admission. Laboratory tests showed anaemia with a slight increase in acute phase reactants. Cardiac biomarkers were negative. The ECG was normal and the chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, not present in a previous one a year earlier. With the initial suspicion of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, stable exertional angina and secondary heart failure, an echocardiogram was requested which showed a mass measuring 4 x 5 cm dependent on the left atrium and which protruded in diastole from the fossa ovalis into the ventricle, producing mitral stenosis. Subsequently, a cardiac catheterisation was performed in which no angiographically significant coronary lesions were observed. On suspicion of atrial myxoma, the patient underwent surgery and the diagnosis was confirmed by histology. Four months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic and there is no evidence of recurrence.   "
"A 62-year-old male, ex-smoker with no other history of interest, was admitted to the ICU of our centre for convulsive status. According to his family, in recent weeks he had been irritable and childish, and in the last few days he had complained of heaviness and numbness in his right limbs. The seizures were controlled with i.v. phenytoin. There were no notable findings in the tests (laboratory tests, ECG, brain CT) performed in the emergency, except for right basal atelectasis in the chest X-ray. A lumbar puncture showed acellular CSF but with hyperproteinorrache (72 mg/dl protein) and EEG with left temporal irritative activity. A brain MRI study showed a hypersignal lesion on the left temporal lobe (FLAIR and diffusion sequences), which did not change after administration of paramagnetic contrast, nor did it present foci of haemorrhage in the evolution.  Treatment with phenytoin, acyclovir (pending PCR for herpes simplex) and antibiotherapy (pneumonia) with Tazocel and Teicoplanin was added. He did not present seizures again and remained afebrile, and was transferred to the Internal Medicine ward. On admission there were no notable findings in the physical examination and in the neurological examination he was conscious, with nominal dysphasia, inappropriate mood, attention deficit and tendency to fabulate and slight right hemiparesis. In the following days he improved (he recovered paresis and his language normalised) although he persisted with moria and Korsakoff's syndrome. Treatment was completed with acyclovir (on the sixth day he received a negative PCR for HSV) and antibiotherapy. Laboratory studies were irrelevant, except for mild elevation of CEA (3.9 ng/ml). Anti-Hu antibodies, antithyroid antibodies, serology (lupus, HIV, neurotropic virus) were negative. Screening for occult neoplasia began with thoracoabdominal CT (normal except for atelectasis/ILD pneumonia), bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (negative), upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, intestinal transit, urological assessment, bone scintigraphy and bone marrow biopsy. Given the normality of these studies, and with the diagnosis of ELP, a whole-body PET scan was requested, which revealed the presence of fluoroglucose hyperuptake at the pharyngolaryngeal level, as well as small satellite lymphadenopathies. The finding of PET was confirmed with a CT scan of the neck and an anatomo-pathological study of the lesion, which was diagnostic of epidermoid carcinoma of the pyriform sinus.   "
"This is a 76-year-old woman who was admitted to the vascular surgery department for postphlebitic syndrome. During her stay on the ward she showed clinical deterioration and was transferred to the ICU on 10/5/03 with severe sepsis. His past history of interest included high blood pressure, obesity, arthrosis and resection of a tubular adenoma of the colon. In August 2000 he underwent cholecystectomy for lithiasic cholecystitis with significant subhepatic inflammatory plastron that required subtotal resection of the gallbladder. On admission, he developed DVT of IBD with subsequent PTE and atrial fibrillation, starting treatment with amiodarone and dicoumarin. During the last month he was in outpatient care due to non-specific digestive symptoms, with elevated GGT and AF observed in analytical control. On examination in the ICU she was stuporous, icteric and with arterial hypotension. O2 saturation was preserved with a mask. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic at 80 bpm, without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation was normal. The abdomen was globular, painful on palpation in the right hemiabdomen, although without signs of peritoneal irritation and the IBD showed good evolution of its thrombosis. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (37,000/mm3) with neutrophilia, urea 1.83 g/l, creatinine 4.2 mg/dl total bilirubin 8.6 mg/dl, with a direct fraction of 5.7 mg/dl, AST 312 U/l, ALT 106 U/l, GGT 416 U/l. With the diagnosis of sepsis of biliary origin, treatment was started with fluid therapy, dopamine and empirical antibiotics with piperacillin/tazobactam, obtaining a good initial response. Complementary tests performed: CT scan of the abdomen (11/5/03) showing multiple hypodense images in the hepatic parenchyma suggesting abscesses. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram, which confirmed the existence of endocarditis at the mitral subvalvular level leading to grade II insufficiency. Following this finding, vancomycin and gentamicin were added to the antibiotic treatment. FNA of a liver lesion. ERCP did not show dilatation of the biliary tract, although papillotomy was performed to ensure biliary drainage. Subsequent evolution was unfavourable with the establishment of refractory BMDS and exitus 96 hours after admission to the ICU. We requested a necropsy, which revealed multicentric cholangiocarcinoma, with multiple nodules throughout the organ, local extension to the gallbladder bed and extrahepatic bile ducts, regional metastases to lymph nodes in the hepatic hilum and distant metastases, manifested by microscopic foci in the lung.  There was also extensive intratumoral necrosis with superinfection by Enterobacter cloacae, also isolated in blood and FNA sample, which leads us to suppose that it was the germ responsible for the septic picture.

Chest X-ray showed a fibrous tract with residual appearance in the right lower lobe. Gastroduodenal transit was normal. Abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT scan were normal. Gastroscopy was normal. Temporal artery biopsy was performed and showed only signs of arteriosclerosis. With the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, treatment was started with deflazacort 30 mg/24 hours, with improvement and normalisation of haemoglobin, CRP and ESR. Deflazacort was progressively reduced and 7 months after starting treatment the patient was asymptomatic and was on a dose of 6 mg deflazacort per day. When the patient was 69 years old, she was being treated with deflazacort 6 mg/24, paroxetine 20 mg/24, gabapentin 400 mg/12 h, omeprazole 20 mg/24, lormetazepam 1 mg/24. A routine check-up had been performed 6 months earlier, the patient was asymptomatic and haemoglobin, ESR and CRP were normal. She consulted for febrile fever and occasionally fever of 38.5 ºC predominantly in the evening with no apparent source, dry cough, anorexia, and diffuse abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal. Blood tests showed haemoglobin 10.4 g/dL, Ht 31.9% (normal MCV, MCH and RDW). ESR 109 mm, and CRP 93 mg/dL. Biochemical analysis showed GGT 220 U/L, GPT 45 U/L, GOT 44 U/L, and ALP 153 U/L, iron 20 ug/dL, and ferritin 441.6 ng/ml. CK. Proteinogram normal. Normal thyroid hormones.

Rheumatoid factor, ANA, AMA, ANCA and anti LKM negative. Faecal occult blood was negative. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly. The spine X-ray showed an area of sclerosis at L4, which in the lumbar spine CT scan corresponded to a bone infarction at L4. There were no significant findings on abdominal ultrasound. Thoracic-abdominal CT showed only a pericardial effusion. Gastroscopy was normal and colonoscopy showed diverticula and internal haemorrhoids.  The ECG showed sinus rhythm Fc 90 x' q in DIII and AVF and lack of septal vector activation. An echocardiogram showed severe anteroposterior pericardial effusion associated with a pattern of poor ventricular relaxation, without haemodynamic compromise. Pericardiocentesis was performed and approximately 200 cc of yellowish serous-fibrinous fluid was obtained, with a gelatinous character that solidified at rest; pericardial fluid analysis showed red blood cells 680/mm3, leukocytes 30 mm3, glucose 98 mg/dL, proteins 4.46 g/dL, LDH 284 UL, ADA 18 U/L; pericardial fluid culture was sterile, ZN stain negative; cytology was negative for malignant cells, with abundant fibrin, some inflammatory and mesothelial cells without atypia. The cardiac study was completed with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy which showed no perfusion abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischaemia or necrosis. A temporal artery biopsy showed a transmural inflammatory infiltrate consisting of a mixture of polymorphonuclear, lymphocytes and giant cells; the infiltrate was accompanied by fracture of the internal elastic band. Treatment with deflazacort at 60 mg/day was started, improving the symptoms in a few days, and the pericardial effusion resolved in 3 months.   "
"A 50-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension under treatment and appendicectomy at the age of 25, consulted for epigastralgia, melena and asthenia for the last fifteen days. He did not report dysphagia, heartburn or altered bowel habits. The physical examination was normal, there were no palpable masses or visceromegaly in the abdomen, and there were no signs of malnutrition. Laboratory tests showed the presence of hypochromic microcytic anaemia with Hgb of 10g/dl and Ht of 33%. Chest and abdominal X-rays showed no alterations of interest. Upper endoscopy showed a normal oesophagus, a gastric cavity without haematic debris with normal mucosa and erosions on an oedematous mucosa in the duodenal bulb; biopsies were taken from the antrum and body, and the biopsies were reported as chronic gastritis without activity, and helicobacter pylori was not detected. In the abdominal ultrasound, the liver, gall bladder and pancreas were normal. With the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to erosive duodenitis and anaemia secondary to digestive losses, he was discharged for outpatient follow-up with treatment with antisecretory drugs. The patient was readmitted three weeks later for a new episode of melena. A new upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, revealing a normal oesophagus, gastric cavity mucosa and duodenal bulb, with isolated haematic remains at the level of the second portion of the duodenum, It was therefore decided to perform a pulsation enteroscopy, revealing a friable, ulcerated tumour in the proximal jejunum that partially stenosed the jejunal lumen and did not allow the endoscope to pass, but did allow multiple biopsies to be taken at the edges of the tumour. An intestinal transit was carried out in which a short stenosis was observed in the proximal jejunum, which allowed the passage of contrast material.  The extension study was completed with an abdominal CT scan, which revealed the presence of a mass in the proximal jejunum with no significant locoregional or retroperitoneal adenopathies, no focal hepatic lesions suggestive of metastasis, and no other radiological alterations that could be assessed. With the diagnosis of low-grade leiomyosarcoma of the small intestine and after ruling out distant tumour extension or local invasion in the imaging studies, surgical treatment was decided with resection of the tumour and subsequent duodeno-jejunal anastomosis. The patient's evolution was satisfactory and did not require adjuvant treatment.   "
"A 51 year old male presented to the dermatology department for 6-7 days with nodular, erythematous-violaceous, painful lesions on the legs and dorsum of the feet, accompanied by swelling of the ankles.  The patient was in good general health, with no other accompanying symptoms. His personal history included three episodes of acute pancreatitis secondary to chronic ethylism, the last one a year ago. The magnetic resonance cholangiography performed at that time had detected chronic pancreatitis, as well as two pancreatic pseudocysts, for which he was being monitored by the Digestive Service. A skin biopsy and analytical study were performed and treatment was started with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and omeprazole. Histopathology of one of the skin lesions showed an intense inflammatory infiltrate in the fatty lobule consisting of neutrophilic polymorphonuclear cells, soaps secondary to fat necrosis and areas of haemorrhage.  The analytical study showed pancreatic amylase values of 469 IU/L. In view of these findings, compatible with the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis, the patient was admitted to the hospital to be studied and monitored for a possible exacerbation of his chronic pancreatitis. The evolution of the skin lesions was good, despite the fact that the patient had discontinued anti-inflammatory treatment due to epigastralgia. However, the epigastralgia did not subside and even became more continuous and intense, and was subsequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The clinical manifestations and amylase levels were controlled during admission by conservative measures, but the control CT scan showed an enlargement of the pancreatic head, with dilatation of the duct of Wirsung, partial destruction of the pancreatic gland, peripancreatic, celiac and gastrohepatic ligament adenopathies, together with portal vein thrombosis, which required anticoagulant treatment. Five months after the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis, the control CT scan reported resolution of the pancreatic pathology, with portal cavernomatous transformation and persistence of small lymphadenopathies with no clear pathological significance, so that the picture was finally interpreted as an exacerbation of his chronic pancreatitis.   "
"A 51-year-old woman with no previous history of interest was admitted for stroke with dysnomia and right paresis, with multiple ischaemic foci demonstrated by scanner and magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting embolic origin. On admission he was afebrile, with blood pressure 120/60 mmHg, and on neurological examination he had reduced verbal fluency with frequent paraphasias, right central facial, a right brachio-crural motor deficit and an indifferent right plantar response. The systemic examination was normal except for petechiae in the tibial region of the right lower extremity and splinter haemorrhages in several fingers of both hands. Laboratory tests were normal except for an increase in acute phase reactants. Electrocardiogram, transcranial Doppler, continuous carotid Doppler and fundus examination were normal. Transthoracic and transesophageal cardiac ultrasound showed a patent foramen ovale, mitral prolapse and a 15 mm wart on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mild mitral insufficiency (MI). With the suspicion of subacute bacterial endocarditis, empirical antibiotic treatment was started with Vancomycin and Gentamicin after blood cultures had been taken, the patient being afebrile, a situation in which she remained during admission. The chest X-ray showed a nodule in the left lower lobe (LII) which was later confirmed by scanner as a 3.5 centimetre mass in LII, satellite nodules, contralateral lymphadenopathy and carcinomatous lymphangitis suggestive of a neoplastic process. Seven days after the start of antibiotic treatment, after learning of the negative results of the cultures, a control echocardiogram was performed in which the appearance of a new wart (5.7 mm) and a decrease in size of the previous wart (9.1 mm) was observed. New blood cultures were performed to emphasise the differential diagnosis of endocarditis with negative cultures (HACEK, fungi) and serologies for Legionella, Bartonella, Coxiella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma... On the 8th day after starting treatment, she presented with non-specific pain in the left hypochondrium, and an abdominal ultrasound was performed with the suspicion of splenic embolism, but no pathology was found. On the 9th day he presented a syncopal picture in the context of a transient ischaemic accident (transient weakness of the left upper limb). On the 11th day he presented a significant clinical deterioration due to ictal symptoms with total involvement of the anterior circulation of the left middle cerebral artery (global aphasia, visual inattention and right hemiplegia). The control echocardiogram showed progression of the previous lesions and a new wart on the atrial side of the mitral valve. Given the poor clinical and echocardiographic evolution, a diagnosis of ETNB was made and a biopsy of the pulmonary mass was performed, this being an adenocarcinoma. Treatment with intravenous (IV) heparin was started due to the association of NBTE and hypercoagulability, and the onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was observed, with increased fibrinogen and PDF Hypercoagulability studies, cryoglobulinaemia, antiphospholipid, HIV, HBV, HCV and ANA markers were negative, as were the 12 blood culture samples and the various serologies mentioned above. The patient's age, sex and the presence of high tumour markers CA 12.5 and CA 15.3 led us to search for primary adenocarcinoma in the breast and ovary, but no findings were found. There was no clinical improvement and radiological worsening despite treatment with i.v. heparin. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with emboligenic phenomena in the context of paraneoplasia. The patient's situation with a PS4 contraindicated any chemotherapy treatment with palliative intent, being only subsidiary to palliative symptomatic treatment. In this context, the patient was transferred to the Palliative Care Unit.   "
"A 39-year-old man, with no personal history of interest except for subclinical hypothyroidism, was referred from primary care for assessment of a purplish discolouration of the distal phalanx of the second, third and fourth fingers of both hands for 15 days, in addition to a sensation of coldness in the aforementioned areas; the lesions were persistent in both warm and cold environments, and no previous episodes of pallor or blushing were observed. No family history of interest was found. The patient was not taking any vasoconstrictor medication. Physical examination revealed purplish discolouration and coldness at the distal ends of both hands in a fairly symmetrical manner, with these changes being more noticeable in the second, third and fourth fingers. The distal pulses were preserved, and no other anatomical areas were affected. No sclerodactyly, punctate scars or other significant findings suggestive of scleroderma were observed at this time. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed no abnormalities. Several complementary tests, analytical and imaging tests were performed. Blood count, electrolytes, coagulation, liver function, renal function, arterial blood gases, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complement levels, immunoglobulins, cryoagglutinins, cryoglobulins and tumour markers were normal. A thyroid function study showed subclinical hypothyroidism, with normal antithyroglobulin and antiperoxidase antibodies. HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis serologies were negative.  Immunology revealed positive ANA titre 1/2560 with nucleolar pattern and negative anti-DNA, ENA, anticardiolipin, scl70, anticentromere and rheumatoid factor antibodies. Chest CT scan was strictly normal. Two months later the patient began to present sclerodactyly and punctate scars on the finger tips and symmetrical induration of the presternal skin and laterocervical region. Treatment was started with pentoxifylline, oral corticosteroids in a descending pattern and azathioprine, with good control of his pathology.   "
"52-year-old male with a history of splenectomy at the age of 8 years due to possible B-thalassaemia and no cardiovascular risk factors. Smoker of 1 pack/day and moderate drinker. Allergic to pyrazolones. Risky sexual relations in his youth. He was admitted for presenting, coinciding with a chronic dental infection, headache with oral discomfort for a week, to which had been added 48 hours earlier facial paralysis, initially on the left, of sudden onset, which after 24 hours became bilateral with no other accompanying symptoms. General examination revealed angioma on the forehead and right eye, together with bilateral parotid swelling. Initial neurological examination revealed bilateral peripheral facial paralysis causing dysarthria with bilateral Bell's sign. Tearing and hearing were not affected. Taste alteration in the anterior third of the tongue. During the days following admission, paraesthesia was added to the fingers, initially in the right upper limb and later bilaterally, and loss of strength in the 4 limbs, predominantly proximal, with paresis 4/5 in the right upper limb and 4+/5 in the left upper limb on neurological examination, together with bilateral tricipital and right stylo-radial arreflexia. The clinical picture continued to progress with the addition of paresis in the lower extremities 4/5 of the bilateral hip flexors of right predominance with abolished osteotendinous patellar and Achilles reflexes. Independent gait with clumsiness, preserving tiptoe and heel gait but with weakness in both quadriceps. He had a normal chest X-ray with normal blood count, biochemistry and coagulation. Serology (Borrelia, Brucella, toxoplasma, rubella, lupus, EBV, CMV, HSV, HIV, Varicella-Zoster, measles and mumps) in blood and CSF were negative. Blood RCT and immunoglobulin quantification were normal. Neuroimaging tests, CT and brain MRI, showed no findings of interest. CSF showed increased protein (1.5 gr/dl), no leukocytes and positive pandy with negative cytology. No oligoclonal bands were observed. Tensilon test was negative. ENG was performed on the seventh day of admission, where absence of bilateral peripheral facial response was observed with signs of sensory-motor polyneuropathy in the extremities, subsequently repeated after 14 days, persisting motor conduction disturbances of demyelinating type with severe bilateral facial involvement, proximal-distal in the upper extremities and proximal predominance in the lower extremities. Initially, treatment with corticoids was started with no clear clinical response and, given the progressive evolution of the condition, treatment was started with immunoglobulins i.v. for 5 days (28 g/day), with no further progression of the symptoms and with the onset of clinical remission mainly in the extremities and very discreetly of the facial paralysis that persisted at the time of discharge. After six months, the patient has shown complete improvement in both the facial paralysis and the weakness in the limbs and does not require further rehabilitation treatment.   "
"A 73-year-old patient with a history of arterial hypertension and polyarthrosis presented to the emergency department with abdominal distension and pain associated with constipation and febrile fever. The symptoms had started three weeks earlier and worsened during the four days prior to admission. During this period, an upper gastrointestinal fibroendoscopy (oesophagus, stomach and duodenum) and a colonoscopy (up to the splenic angle) were performed, but no abnormalities were found. Physical examination revealed a low-grade fever (37.6º C), a distended abdomen, diffusely painful on palpation, tympanised on percussion, with scant borborygmi but no evidence of peritonism, pulmonary auscultation with decreased ventilation in the lower half of the right hemithorax and the onset of intense pain on palpation and percussion of the last three dorsal spinous processes. Analyses showed 8.2 x 109 leukocytes / L, haemoglobin 136 g / L, platelets 186 x 109 / L. Except for glycaemia (123 mg/dl), the following laboratory parameters were normal or negative: urea, creatinine, bilirubin, transaminases, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium, phosphorus, creatine phosphokinase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), proteinogram, immunoglobulin dosage, alpha-fetoprotein, CA 19 antigens. 9 and CA 125 antigens, as well as general urinalysis. ESR and C-reactive protein were elevated, with values of 85 mm / 1 h and 133 mg / L (normal < 5 mg / L), respectively. Mantoux intradermal reaction (10 IU RT-23) was positive, with an induration of 25 mm. Chest X-ray showed an image compatible with right lower lobe atelectasis in the context of an ipsilateral pleural effusion. There were no signs suggestive of adenopathy or alterations in the cardiopericardial silhouette. A thoracoabdominal CT scan confirmed the existence of a right pleural effusion and identified prominent degenerative changes along the dorsolumbar spine but, above all, erosions in the vertebral plates adjacent to the D10-D11 disc space. A lumbar MRI showed hyposignal on T1-weighted sequences and hypersignal on T2-weighted sequences in these vertebrae and their corresponding disc, with morphological alterations typical of infectious spondylodiscitis D10-D11. Three serial blood cultures were negative. Samples obtained by aspiration of the D10-D11 space showed gram-positive cocci chains, which were subsequently recovered and typed as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pleural fluid analysis showed pH: 7.55; leucocytes: 8.4 x 109/L (58% neutrophils, 26% eosinophils, 16% lymphocytes), protein: 48 g/L (ratio to serum protein: 0.65), glucose: 125 mg/dl, ADA: 25.92 IU/ml, LDH: 362 U/L (pleural LDH/serum LDH ratio: 0.8). Both auramine-rhodamine staining and Löwenstein-Jensen medium culture of pleural fluid were negative and cytology showed no evidence of neoplastic cells.  The patient was initially treated intravenously with amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (1 g / 200 mg, every 8 hours). After 21 days, she was switched to the oral route (875 / 125 mg, every 8 hours) for 6 weeks. The evolution was favourable and she was able to start walking with a dorsolumbar corset after the fourth week. One month after the end of antibiotic therapy, a control chest CT scan still showed a discrete pleural effusion, but the patient had only mild mechanical dorsalgia, her ESR had decreased to 21 mm / 1 h and her CRP was 2.4 mg/L. Outpatient follow-up continued for a further three years, during which time the evolution was favourable and a D10-D11 vertebral block was formed.   "
"A 64-year-old Italian man was admitted in March 2005 for severe headache, continuous fever and pancytopenia. His history showed that he was suffering from NHL type B grade II (Real) already treated with chemotherapy according to the CHOP-R scheme and then with high doses of cyclophosphamide in order to mobilise the stem cells in anticipation of an autologous transplant, which was never carried out. A recent total body CT scan showed remission of the lymphomatous disease, while the osteomedullary biopsy revealed secondary myelodysplasia in the absence of neoplastic infiltration. On admission to hospital, the physical examination revealed a fever of 39°C, cutaneous and mucosal pallor and splenomegaly, BP 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 128 beats per minute. The rest of the initial physical examination is compatible with normality. Complementary examinations. Initial tests showed, among other things, pancytopenia with neutropenia of 830/ul. Virological examinations (negative) and serial blood cultures were performed. A CT scan of the skull showed no acute focal lesions or signs of cerebral hypertension. The patient was treated with supportive therapy, granulocyte growth factors, antifungals and broad-spectrum antibiotics, with remission of the haematological picture and resolution of fever. Due to the persistence of headache and the successive appearance of meningeal signs, a diagnostic lumbar puncture was performed. Microscopic analysis of the CSF showed an increase in the total number of cells, consisting of a large number of neutrophils, megakaryocytes and myeloid cells with intermediate maturation; a picture representative of a medullary population. Immunohistochemical cytological analysis was compatible with myeloid metaplasia: factor VIII and myeloperoxidase positive in morphologically compatible elements. The repeated analysis of CSF compared to peripheral blood and the fact that no spinal tap was traumatic or difficult to perform excludes contamination. In the meantime, the blood culture was positive for Sterotrophomonas maltophilia, which was sensitive to antibiotic treatment. Two weeks after admission, the patient's neurological condition worsened, he went into a cerebral coma and died.   "
"A 52-year-old man with a personal history of 10 cigarettes/day ex-smoking and diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve with normal systolic function. A year earlier he had undergone surgery for acute sigmoid diverticulitis with perforation and peritonitis and 4 months after the operation he developed right femoral-popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and had been treated with acenocoumarol since then. The study performed 3 months after the episode to rule out hypercoagulability syndrome showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 12.67 sec (VN 9-12 sec), an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 66.23 sec (VN 26-39 sec), platelets 140. 000 /dL, Ig G anticardiolipin antibodies 127 GPL/ml (VN 3.2-16.5) and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies 9.2 GPL/ml (VN 3.9-41). Serum levels of antithrombin III, protein S and protein C were normal. He consulted for asthenia and intermittent fever of 38ºC since one month before, which in the 4 days prior to admission had begun with haemoptotic expectoration, dyspnoea on moderate exertion and the fever had become persistent. Physical examination showed a good general condition, with only a temperature of 38ºC and no other relevant alterations except for the colostomy. The blood test showed haemoglobin 14.5 g/dl, red blood cells 4,650,000/mm3, mean corpuscular volume 89.7 µmc, leukocyte count 8170/dl and leukocyte count was normal. ESR was 50 mm in the first hour. INR was 2.5, adjusted for acenocoumarol. Biochemistry, ions and transaminases were normal. Urinary sediment showed no abnormalities. Rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane, anti-peroxidase, anti-histone, anti-Ro, anti-SSA and anti-SM were normal or negative. Arterial blood gases FiO2 0.21: pH 7.53, pO2 65 mmHg, pCO2 39 mmHg. The electrocardiogram was normal and the echocardiogram confirmed a bicuspid aortic valve without other alterations. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates with normal cardiac silhouette. Blood cultures and sputum culture for bacteria and mycobacteria were negative. Ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and computed tomography angiography showed no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, so anticoagulant treatment was discontinued and treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was started, with clinical improvement and disappearance of fever, but haemoptysis sputum and infiltrates persisted in the chest X-ray. Bronchoscopy was performed and no endoscopic abnormalities were found. Bronchoaspirate culture showed no growth for bacteria, fungi or mycobacteria and cytology showed no malignant cells. Spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion were normal. After discharge from hospital, the patient continued to present haemoptotic sputum. A new high-resolution computed axial tomography (HRCT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass. A new bronchoscopy showed no intrabronchial alterations and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 512 cells/ml: neutrophilic polymorphonuclear 1%, eosinophilic polymorphonuclear 1% and histiocytes 98%. Prussian blue staining showed 80% haemosiderophages.  Peripheral blood levels of anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant antibodies remained elevated. Based on the findings described above, the patient was diagnosed with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and secondary pulmonary haemorrhage, and treatment was restarted with acenocoumarol and acetylsalicylic acid. During one year of follow-up he presented occasional haemoptotic sputum, but the chest X-ray and pulmonary function (spirometry, diffusion and arterial gases) remained normal and only the CT scan showed some areas of ground glass.   "
"We present the clinical case of a 67-year-old male, with a history of moderate-severe enolism, arterial hypertension and ischaemic heart disease, who was transferred to the Emergency Department from another centre where he had come 4 hours after ingestion of an OP (Metasystox®: oxydemeton-methyl) in an attempt at autolysis. At the centre of origin, he underwent gastric lavage and was given a dose of activated charcoal. On arrival at the ED, the patient was conscious and oriented, hypotensive and bradycardic, with clear muscarinic manifestations: profuse sweating, sialorrhoea, abundant tear secretion, and diffuse colicky pain with nausea and vomiting. At the nicotinic level, there were no motor deficits but there was some perceptible fasciculation in both thighs. During his stay in the Emergency Department, the patient presented generalised myoclonus, miosis and desaturation with peripheral cyanosis, probably secondary to the fasciculations of the peripheral muscles and the diaphragm. In view of the symptoms, joint treatment with atropine and pralidoxime (1 g over 30 minutes) was started, achieving an improvement in the peripheral symptoms, with a decrease in the number of fasciculations and disappearance of the abdominal cramps. A second dose of 25 g of activated charcoal and a bolus of intravenous diazepam were administered to control the convulsions. Given the refractory nature of the seizures, orotracheal intubation was performed to protect the airway and treatment was started with pralidoxime (12 g/day) and atropine (20 mg/day), both in continuous infusion. Under these conditions he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where he remained for 12 days. During the first 10 days post-intoxication, he continued with the treatment given in the emergency department, according to the doses specified in table I. Until day 6 post-intoxication, the patient presented miosis and high peristalsis, and from this day onwards he manifested mydriasis and impaired tolerance to enteral nutrition as a consequence of the absence of peristalsis. This improves as the dose of atropine is reduced. However, reactive mydriasis persisted until discharge to the ward. Another symptomatology of the patient, characteristic of OP poisoning, is generalised myoclonus and thoracic muscle weakness. This weakness could also be a consequence of the sedation to which he is subjected due to his agitated state. By day 5 post-intoxication, isolated facial myoclonus is noticeable, still in the context of neurological symptoms. Progressive recovery of limb strength begins on day 6 post-intoxication, and is complete by day 9. However, between these days, even under treatment with pralidoxime in continuous perfusion, the patient develops an IS with proximal and facial muscle weakness. This led to hypoventilation due to muscle fatigue. As for the respiratory symptoms, which are critical in patients with OP poisoning, there is an episode of initial respiratory failure, which is subsequently corrected by keeping the patient on mechanical ventilation (MV) until 5 days after the poisoning. From this day on, gradual disconnections from MV begin, with the patient tending towards hypoventilation due to muscle fatigue. Improvement in respiratory function, although hampered by nosocomial tracheobronchiolitis due to H. influenzae, became apparent around day 8 post-intoxication. Despite psychomotor agitation, he tolerates MV disconnections allowing extubation one day after initiation. However, a tendency to hypoventilation persists throughout his stay in the ICU. As a biomarker of exposure to the toxicant, plasma cholinesterase levels were assessed. The first measurement, carried out at 16 hours post-ingestion, showed a level of 13 ukat/L (reference range: 89-215 ukat/L). Its evolution can be seen in figure 1.   "
"A 74-year-old woman was admitted to our centre for a week presenting with a sensation of rotatory vertigo with nausea and vomiting, gait instability, horizontal binocular diplopia and speech disturbances. Her personal history included an allergy to iodinated contrast dye and infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma with positive oestrogen and progesterone receptors and negative nodes three years earlier. She underwent surgical treatment and radiotherapy of the residual breast. She was currently in remission and was being treated with anastrozole. Physical examination revealed slurred speech, nystagmus with a rapid rotatory component in all directions of gaze, paresis of the right fourth cranial nerve, disabling truncal ataxia with inability to walk and dysmetria in all four limbs. Upper cortical functions were preserved. General tests showed: normal haemogram, general biochemistry and haemostasis. The usual tumour markers (CA 125, CA 15-3, CA19-9, alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen) were normal. A neuroimaging study with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed and was normal. FCD was suspected and anti-Yo antibodies were determined and were positive at high titres in serum and CSF. While the study of occult neoplasia was being performed, treatment with immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone was started without evident clinical improvement. Thoracic-abdominal CT, mammography, breast MRI and bone scintigraphy showed no evidence of tumour pathology. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed two 15 mm nodular lesions located behind the pancreatic head compatible with mesenteric adenopathy of malignant aetiology. No other foci suspicious for malignancy were observed. Laparotomy and biopsy were performed. The anatomopathological study showed the presence of metastases of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of metastasis of breast carcinoma was considered and the Medical Oncology Department started treatment with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. The clinical evolution of the patient was towards stabilisation without improvement of signs and symptoms, the patient was not able to perform activities of daily living on her own and needed a wheelchair to move around.

"A 32-year-old woman, diagnosed with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome 6 years ago, monitored in the outpatient rheumatology department, on treatment with prednisone (15 mg a day), ASA (100 mg a day), calcium (1 g), vitamin D (800 u) and omeprazole (20 mg a day). The patient reported fever (40 ºC), predominantly in the evening, of one week's duration, with no other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination revealed only hepatosplenomegaly, with no palpable lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures, urine culture and mantoux were negative; echo-Dopler and chest X-ray were normal; thoraco-abdominal CT scan was normal, except for hepatosplenomegaly with no apparent focal lesions. Laboratory tests showed Hb 6.7, leukocytes 1,000 (400 neutrophils, 500 lymphocytes), platelets 60,000, ANA 1/1,280, anti-DNA 42.3, rheumatoid factor 176, CRP 11.9, C3 122/C4 11.2, proteinogram (gamma globulin 44.2) and normal serology. In view of the possible outbreak of SLE, it was decided to transfuse two red blood cell concentrates, daily injections of C-GSF, boluses of 1 g of methylprednisolone for three days, and amikazin and ceftazidime as empirical treatment for neutropenia. After four days with the treatment described, the fever remained at 40 ºC, with similar laboratory values: in a new analysis, Hb 8.5, leukocytes 1,000 (400 neutrophils, 500 lymphocytes), platelets 32,000, thinking that the symptoms did not correspond to an outbreak of the disease. A sternal puncture was performed and abundant haemoparasites of the genus Leishmania were found, confirming the suspected diagnosis. Treatment was started with liposomal amphotericin B 200 mg per day for 5 days, and the patient became afebrile on the second day. Control laboratory tests 10 days after treatment: Hb 11, leucocytes 2600 (1700 neutrophils) and platelets 97,000 at discharge.   "
"A 30-year-old man, who one month before admission presented with cough, headache and progressive dyspnoea on exertion. Two weeks later the patient presented with mucopurulent expectoration and fever of 38ºC. He consulted his doctor who prescribed treatment with amoxicillin and later moxifloxacin and tiotropium bromide. He consulted the emergency department for dyspnoea at rest, severe retrosternal pain and palpitations. He was a non-smoker and had a history of bronchial asthma, which he treated with inhaled salbutamol. On physical examination he presented with A.T.: 110/70 mmHg, 37.5º C, he was conscious, tachypnoeic, sweating, with no jugular ingurgitation. Pulmonary auscultation showed diffuse bilateral crackles and cardiac auscultation showed rhythmic, rapid tones without murmurs or extratonos. The abdomen was soft and depressible with no organomegaly. There was no oedema in the extremities and peripheral pulses were preserved. Laboratory tests showed 18,500 leukocytes with left shift, haemoglobin 16.3 grams/dl, 474,000 platelets, prothrombin activity 73%. D-dimer 920 mg/dl. Baseline arterial blood gases: pH 7.53, pO2 47 mmHg, pCO2 23 mmHg, CO3H 19.2 mmol/l. Normal biochemistry including troponin and CPK. Chest X-ray showed severe cardiomegaly and a bilateral interstitial pattern. In view of these findings, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing severe pericardial effusion, with no evidence of tamponade and a left ventricle of normal dimensions. Admission to the intensive care unit, with treatment with furosemide, levofloxacin, acetylsalicylic acid and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. A new echocardiogram showed signs of tamponade, so a pericardiocentesis was performed, obtaining one litre of serohaematic fluid, with the following biochemical characteristics: LDH 2353 U/l, protein 5.3 gr, 9855 cells with 98% polymorphonuclear. Seven days later, he was transferred to the Internal Medicine Department where the study to determine the aetiology of the pericardial effusion and the interstitial pattern was initiated, and the following tests were performed: antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, Mantoux, negative. The thyroid profile was normal. Pericardial fluid culture was negative, as were three blood cultures. Pathological anatomy of the pericardial fluid was reported as intense acute inflammation and clusters of mesothelial cells with reactive-looking atypia, being negative for malignant cells. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was found to be elevated 21.53 ng/ml. In addition, serologies for human immunodeficiency virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr and Chlamydia pneumoniae were negative except for IgM to cytomegalovirus which was positive. A chest CT scan showed two pathologically sized mediastinal adenopathies of pretracheal location measuring approximately 19 x 15 mm and 18 x 17 mm respectively, and a slightly larger bilateral pleural effusion on the right side. A pulmonary window showed bilateral and diffuse alterations of the lung parenchyma with an interstitial pattern of nodular septal reticulum and lobular centre with areas of patchy alveolar condensation predominantly distributed in the apical segment of the lower lobes and both upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy was performed, observing upper airways, vocal cords and trachea without alterations, there was a widening in the subcarinal area. The bronchial tree showed no alterations. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the apical segment of the culmen, but the examination had to be suspended due to poor tolerance, and neither puncture of the adenopathies nor transbronchial biopsy could be performed. The pathological anatomy of the lavage revealed abundant macrophages and epithelial groups with reactive atypia, compatible with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, secondary to acute lung damage. It was thought that he might have diffuse interstitial lung disease (DIDD) due to the anatomopathological, clinical and radiological features. The first possibility was eosinophilic pneumonia due to the presence of eosinophilia in peripheral blood, and treatment was started with prednisone 1 mg/kg body weight, with a favourable evolution, and he was discharged 25 days after admission, without fever or dyspnoea. Seven days later, the patient presented again with a cough with mucous expectoration and later haemoptysis. Chest X-ray showed no changes, so a chest CT scan was performed, which revealed a ground glass pattern and a moderate bilateral pleural effusion. It was decided to perform a lung biopsy to obtain the diagnosis. The report was diffuse lymphatic permeation (following a nodular interstitial pattern) by a well-differentiated acinar-papillary adenocarcinoma with abundant psammoma bodies. Cells with malignant cytological features compatible with adenocarcinoma were observed in the pleural fluid. Histochemical tests confirmed the pulmonary origin of the adenocarcinoma. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy with the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine. Two cycles have been administered so far, so we do not yet have data on the possible response.   "
"This is a 28-year-old female patient, with no history of previous illnesses, with a clinical picture characterised by complete infectious toxic syndrome and poly-arthralgias in major joints, of seven days' evolution, treated with oral amoxicillin without remission, associated with productive cough with muco-purulent expectoration, progressive dyspnoea on medium to light exertion, liquid stools and urinary symptoms.

During hospitalisation, the patient had deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity verified by venous Doppler ultrasound, severe pericardial effusion corroborated by chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, Doppler echocardiography and acrocyanosis in the distal phalanges of the fingers of both hands. Methylprednisolone 500 mg pulses were administered for 3 consecutive days, followed by prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day and azathioprine 100 mg/day, in addition to anticoagulation with sodium heparin and warfarin. The evolution was unfavourable, with digital necrosis (dry gangrene), associated signs of psychosis, lupus nephropathy and cerebral ischaemia (left hemiparesis), documented with brain CT and electroencephalogram. She was treated with 3 sessions of plasmapheresis weekly for two weeks, pulses of 1 g of cyclophosphamide weekly for 3 consecutive weeks and immunoglobulin 20 g per day (400 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, pentoxifylline, flunarizine, levothyroxine, antivirals and ACE inhibitors, with a favourable evolution. She was discharged after 6 weeks of hospitalisation with neurological sequelae and complete necrosis of the 1st and 2nd distal phalanges of the aforementioned fingers on both hands, which were amputated naturally 9 months after her discharge. She is currently undergoing periodic medical check-ups and treatment with mycophenolate mofetil 1 g/day with favourable evolution.   "
"An 89-year-old male patient with no pathological history of interest consulted for anorexia of one and a half months' duration accompanied by oedema of the hands and feet. He reported some episodes of rectorrhagia. Physical examination only revealed oedema with fovea limited to the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints. With the diagnosis of suspected RS3PE, therapy with prednisone 20 mg/24 hours was started, and the oedema disappeared completely after 5 days of treatment. Given that this syndrome can appear in association with other pathologies, the patient was studied.  In the complementary tests the haemoglobin was Hb 10.3 g/dL, with MCV 94.5 fl. The biochemistry, glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, total calcium, phosphate, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total proteins, GPT, LDH, GGT, Na, K were normal. Cobalamins and folates were normal. Beta-2-microglobulin was normal. The proteinogram showed a monoclonal band to IgA lambda. C-reactive protein and ESR were normal. Interleukin 6 was normal. HIV serology was negative. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. PSA was normal. HLA-B27 phenotype was positive. Bence-Jones proteinuria was negative. Colonoscopy was normal. X-rays of the hands and feet showed no erosive lesions. Thoracic CT in the posterior segment of the LSD showed a pulmonary infiltrate adopting a branched (tree inbud) and nodular morphology; in the LM there was also an infiltrate of branched, nodular morphology and a subsegmental condensation with air bronchogram; biapical pleuroparenchymal tracts with thin-walled cylindrical bronchiectasis in LII and thickening of lingula, and pleura. Abdominal CT scan urinary bladder with thickening of the bladder floor, multiple diverticula, prostatic hypertrophy. Bronchoscopy showed a trachea and left bronchial tree with chronic inflammatory signs, including diverticula and anthracosis plaques throughout the bronchial tree; at the level of the right bronchial tree, in the bronchus intermedius a few mm before reaching the LM entrance, mucous infiltration was observed and at the LM entrance there was a mass of necrotic and very friable appearance that totally obstructed the entrance; a bronchial biopsy was not performed due to bleeding. Cytological examination of the BAS revealed an acute inflammatory smear. The Löwestein culture of the BAS was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient's progress showed that 5 days after starting corticosteroid treatment, the oedema of the hands and feet disappeared, and haemoglobin levels returned to normal one month later. Four months after starting prednisone, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified and isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide were prescribed, and corticosteroid treatment was suspended due to suspicion of Poncet's disease. Three months after starting the tuberculostatics and withdrawing the corticosteroids, the oedema in the hands and feet reappeared, so corticosteroid treatment was reintroduced.   "
"The patient was a 19-year-old male who was admitted with clinical manifestations consisting of intermittent localised pain in the left hemothorax accompanied by cough and febrile fever of one month's duration. In the general laboratory tests performed, the only notable findings were a leukocytosis of 16,500 x 109/l and an ESR of 24 mm in 1h, the rest of the complementary tests, including microbiological tests, were negative. The chest X-ray showed a mass with irregular borders that blurred the contour of the left pulmonary hilum. A chest CT scan confirmed the existence of a mass with sharper borders and hypodense areas in its interior located in the anterior mediastinum and in intimate contact with cardiac structures measuring 10 x 6 cm in diameter. The biopsy obtained by videothoracoscopy of the mass showed that it consisted of a proliferation of Langerhans cells with abundant eosinophils, histochemical stains showed positivity for S-100 and CD1a, being negative for lymphoid markers, all these findings were compatible with the diagnosis of LCH. After receiving 2 lines of chemotherapy treatment and without obtaining an evident response, it was necessary to initiate radiotherapy therapy, during which a lymphadenopathy appeared in the supraclavicular location, which after being biopsied showed evidence of nodular sclerosis-type Hodgkin's disease associated with LCH; after no response was observed to conventional treatment, autotransplantation of peripheral blood haematopoietic precursors was carried out, achieving complete remission of both diseases to date.   "
"A 56 year old woman with mild and inconsistent pain in the right upper half of the upper right hemiarch, thirteen months ago, but which has worsened in the last week, leading the patient to incorrectly think that its origin was in the right upper molar. On inspection, only mesio-distal fissure of the crown of the right upper 1st premolar was observed.  On radiographic examination nothing was found. The emergency treatment was: opening the chamber of this premolar and placing a medicine inside it (Cresophene, Septodont) provisionally covered with a cement (Cavit, Espe). The odontalgia disappeared and subsequently it was planned to perform an endodoncy and place a protective metal-porcelain crown.   "
"A 57-year-old man, with no medical history of interest, presented with an asymptomatic tumour of nine years' evolution at the level of the left jugal mucosa, coinciding with the edentulous area of the second upper molar. The lesion grew slowly and never ulcerated. Intraoral examination showed an exophytic mass of nodular appearance and well delimited, 2 X 2 cm in diameter located in the middle third of the left jugal mucosa that included the caruncle of the mouth of the Stenon duct; the tumour had a pale pink colour and a firm consistency on palpation. After manipulating the left parotid gland to provoke saliva to flow out, we found that the duct was permeable and the saliva was clean and fluid.  Treatment consisted of locating and cannulating the Stenon's duct through its caruncle, using a paediatric intravenous catheter, followed by biopsy-excision of the tumour mass with a cold scalpel, respecting both the path of the duct and its drainage caruncle. We then left an active intraoral drain through the caruncle for one week and applied external pressure to the parotid gland every 48 hours.  Histopathological examination showed fibrosocolagenised tissue oriented in bundles in all planes of the space, without atypia and lined by flat stratified epithelium, compatible with fibrous hyperplasia.   One month after surgery, the patient's upper jaw was rehabilitated with a removable metal-resin prosthesis. After one year of evolution, there have been no recurrences and the drainage of the left parotid gland is normal.  "
"A 16 year old female student, in good general condition, came to our Unit, claiming to have been raped two months prior to the interview. She had not reported the incident due to personal reasons. She consulted about lesions in her mouth of approximately two weeks' evolution, which caused difficulty in phonation and swallowing. During the anamnesis, the patient showed insecurity and concealment in her answers. Examination of the buccal mucosa revealed the typical opaline, slightly raised, greyish-white plaques of syphilitic secondarily and other white lesions surrounded by a red halo, some multiple and some solitary. In figure 1, the white plaques can be seen in both commissures and, in the lower labial mucosa, in the midline, three more plaques. The one closest to the sulcus, opaline white, well circumscribed. Another plaque, approximately 2 cm in diameter, shows a small central red area, and close to the semi-mucosa, another similar one can be observed.  In figure 2, similar plaques are found on the left edge of the tongue, near the tip and in the posterior area. On the right edge, in the middle and posterior part, two similar plaques, each 1.5 cm in diameter, can also be seen. Close to the tip of the tongue, on the edges and extended towards the ventral side, a rough surface can be seen in figure 3. It was clinically diagnosed as hairy leukoplakia (LV) and could not be removed by scraping. The patient gave authorisation for an HIV test, which was carried out the following day and the result of which was delivered in person approximately thirty days later. After a first reactive VDRL (128 dls), the fluorescent treponema antibody test (FTA-ABS), the treponema haematoagglutination test (TPHA), and a spirochete demonstration of the exudate from one of the oral lesions or ""dark field test"" were requested, with a positive result. A mucosal biopsy was performed with a presumptive diagnosis of hairy leukoplakia. Due to the high serology titres obtained, classical treatment for syphilis with benzathine penicillin injections was immediately instituted. The result of the LV biopsy was confirmed. The patient did not return to the clinic and did not withdraw the HIV result, which was reactive. We have tried to locate the young woman to inform her of her condition, monitor the effectiveness of the syphilis treatment, and establish a possible treatment and follow-up of her immunodeficiency.   "
"A 14-month-old boy presented to the HUCA with desquamative skin lesions on the scalp and exudative lesions in the folds and perianal region. A skin biopsy was performed and the diagnosis was LCH. The condition was limited to the skin only and topical treatment was carried out locally. On further examination, localised gingivitis was diagnosed at the level of 83.84.  In order to determine if there was a relationship with the previous skin process, the corresponding biopsy of the marginal gum of 84 was carried out with processing of the sample with haematoxylin-eosin, according to standard technique, for histopathological study. At the same time, an immunohistochemical study is carried out using CD1a markers (surface antigen) and S-100 protein specific to Langerhans cells. The result of the anatomopathological study determined the presence of a squamous epithelium with an infiltrate of polynuclear cells and eosinophils. At the level of the chorion, nodules composed of cells of histiocytic structure with vesicular, clear, dented nuclei, some with an irregular ""coffee bean"" shape, were evident.  Immunohistochemistry showed evidence of positivity for CD1a surface antigen and S-100 protein, effectively determining the oral involvement of the disease.  The patient was classified within the pathology type of multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis.   "
"Male patient, black, 21 years of age, who consulted the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación de Medellín attached to the Universidad de Antioquia, referred by a dentist from a public health institution for presenting an asymptomatic increase in the volume of the mandible, with unknown evolution. Intraorally, excellent dental integrity and good dental occlusion were observed, but there was an increase in volume in the vestibular region involving the body and the symphysis, while lingually, the expansion of the table was only in the area of the lower right canine and bicuspids. The initial panoramic X-ray showed a radiolucent image 10 cm long, multiloculated, located from distal tooth 46 to mesial tooth 33. The mesial root of tooth 46 and the root of tooth 45 showed rhizolysis, with possible pulp necrosis. Teeth 46, 45 and 44 had minimal mobility; the other teeth had normal vitality and the lower dental canal was rejected. There is no alteration in the sensitivity of the mentonian nerve.  The patient consented to the entire treatment by signing the informed consent form. Prior to the initial biopsy an aspirate was taken producing a citrine fluid and the first histopathological study found a lax connective tissue, some multinucleated giant cells with few nuclei and a thin band of keratin; there was no evidence of epithelial tissue but it was considered as insufficient sample. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of keratocystic odontogenic tumour was made, due to the presence of a keratin band. After this procedure, the lesion became superinfected and the patient had to be hospitalised due to the severity of the clinical picture; this condition was used to perform a second biopsy under general anaesthesia 8 days later, in which a capsule made up of connective tissue with an intense inflammatory infiltrate and epithelial tissue with several layers of cells was found, which gave the diagnosis: inflammatory root cyst. Given the ambiguity of the diagnosis and the aggressiveness of the lesion, it was decided to perform the intervention with the first diagnosis (keratocystic odontogenic tumour -exkeratocyst-). With this diagnosis it was decided to plan an aggressive surgical treatment and it was decided to order endodontic treatment from 46 to 33 (9 teeth) prior to the surgical procedure, as the dental apices were immersed in the cavity and the curettage itself would cause amputation of the pulp vascular bundles, in addition, according to the diagnosis, it is a very recurrent lesion. This endodontic treatment lasted 3 months due to the difficulty of sealing the canals due to the presence of an amber-coloured liquid draining through the pulp chambers. After this time, the production of liquid content ceased and the endodontic treatment was completed.  The surgical phase was performed under general anaesthesia. A trapezoidal flap was raised from distal 46 to distal 33. When the flap was reflected, it was found to be expanded in its entire length and perforated in the bicuspid area (teeth 44 and 45), where the biopsies had previously been taken. We proceeded to remove all the expanded vestibular cortex until we had complete access to the cystic cavity. The thick fibrous capsule covering the osseous defect was found and removed. The bone cavity is reamed with rotary cutting instruments and the entire bone defect is brushed with Carnoy's solution. Some perforations of the lingual cortex are visible, which are cauterised with an electroscalpel due to the risk of invasion of the tumour lesion into the lingual soft tissues. Due to the weakening of the mandibular basilar border, a reconstruction plate is placed to avoid intra- or postoperative fracture. Before suturing the flap, the bone defect is filled with fibrillar collagen and medicated with analgesics and antibiotics. The tissue obtained is sent to pathology. The histopathological report of the surgical specimen shows fibroconnective tissue devoid of epithelium and a post-surgical diagnosis of an aneurysmal bone cyst was obtained. Because the second biopsy showed an epithelium, the diagnosis was misleading but, evaluating the three histopathological samples, it was considered that the epithelial tissue of the second biopsy was the product of the inflammatory reaction, while the initial biopsy and the surgical specimen showed no epithelial component; it was decided to consider it an aneurysmal bone cyst. The patient was evaluated at 8 and 15 days and then at 2 months, 10 months and 2 years. At the follow-up appointment at 2 months pulp necrosis and fistula were found at the level of 47, which was adjacent to the lesion and the mesial root apex had been amputated during the surgical procedure. Endodontics was performed and the infection resolved. He also presented with right mentonian nerve paraesthesia and was prescribed B-complex tablets for one month. A new post-surgical assessment was carried out 10 months later and adequate bone healing was found, but there was an occlusal sequela, as the teeth that were left without bone support due to being immersed in the bone defect (teeth 44 to 33) were intruded and produced an open bite. Two years later a new clinical and radiographic check-up was carried out where it was found that: teeth 44 to 33 remained in open bite, tooth 44 was also slightly vestibularised. The panoramic radiograph shows good bone filling, but the three-dimensional tomography shows that there is a defect of about 6 mm in diameter that compromises the apex of 44 and 43, and that the bone has yet to regenerate, and the paraesthesia still persists two years later. The intraoral image shows that the enlargement produced by the expansion of the lesion of the lingual plate at the level of teeth 43, 44 and 45 still persists.   "
"We present the case of a 27-year-old woman who was seen in the emergency department complaining of metamorphopsia in her OD. Her VA was 0.6 in the OD and 1.0 in the OI and on funduscopic examination she had several rounded whitish foci scattered in the posterior pole of both eyes, one of them juxtafoveal in the OD and of a more greyish colour with a perilesional neurosensory detachment, microhaemorrhages and hard exudation that raised suspicion of the existence of a subretinal membrane. No inflammatory signs were found in the anterior chamber or vitreous.  FFA (fluorescein angiography) showed a very early block of fluorescence in all foci, which rapidly changed to frank hyperfluorescence, more noticeable in late stages in the focus suspected of having an associated membrane (NVSR). In some foci, a small area of central block persisted. In the AVI (indocyanine green angiography), fluorescence block was observed from early stages and throughout the angiogram, except in the case of the suspected NVSR focus, where a hot spot appeared in early stages within a hypofluorescent plaque, which in late stages gave rise to plaque hyperfluorescence, confirming the diagnosis of NVSR.  In both FFA and AVI we found more foci of activity than those seen in the fundus. A complete blood work-up was carried out, including biochemistry and a blood bank, an HLA study was requested (B7 and DR2: for PHOS and AMPPE, A29 for Birdshot), which was negative; a radiological study of the chest was also carried out to rule out tuberculosis and serology to rule out syphilis and Lyme disease, which was normal in all cases. Corticosteroid treatment was started at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg body weight/day. VA improved to 0.8 and remained stable until the last check-up 3 months later. The foci progressively evolved towards pigmentation.   "
"A 33-year-old woman, 34 weeks pregnant (third pregnancy) with a controlled pregnancy and no history of interest, was admitted to the emergency department for headaches, epigastric pain and blurred vision of 3 days' duration. The patient's blood pressure (BP) was 210/130 mmHg. Physical examination revealed oedema (+ + + + +) in both lower limbs, with fovea. Laboratory data showed elevated transaminases and bilirubin, and a slight decrease in platelets: red blood cells 4.52; haemoglobin 12 g/dl; haematocrit 4.52; haemoglobin 12 g/dl; haemoglobin 12 g/dl. /dl; haematocrit 35% (these data in a pregnant woman suggest haemoconcentration); platelets 150; coagulation study: normal; creatinine 1.48 mg/dl; aspartate amino transferase (A.S.T.): 885.2 international units (I.U.); alanine amino transferase (A.L.T.): 334 I.U.; total bilirubin: 4.41 mg/dl; proteinuria was 500 mg/dl. Given the patient's poor general condition it was not possible to determine visual acuity. Ophthalmoscopy showed oedema of both optic discs with serous retinal detachment, affecting both maculae, bullous in the right eye and somewhat flatter in the left eye. There were haemorrhages in the posterior pole of both eyes and focal narrowing of the retinal arteries. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where perfusion with Labetalol (5 mg per ml, 10 ml every hour) was started and intravenous (IV) Enalapril (1 mg every 6 hours) was prescribed. The BP decreased but did not reach normal levels. In view of this situation, an emergency caesarean section was performed and a male foetus weighing 1,800 grams was obtained. After the caesarean section the patient suffered oliguria from which she subsequently recovered. Transaminases, bilirubin, platelets and diuresis normalised, and control of BP was achieved with antihypertensive treatment. The patient was seen again by our department 5 days later, presenting: visual acuity of 1.0 in the right eye and 1.0 difficult in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes and anterior chamber biomicroscopy was normal. Fundus examination showed persistent but flat macular serous detachments. Optic disc oedema and peripapillary exudative detachment persisted in both eyes. In the right eye there was a bullous detachment with level, located between the inferior vascular arcades, in the nasal area and inferior to the disc. In the left eye it was possible to distinguish a temporal demarcation line to the macula delimiting the serous detachment, initially bullous. In the early stages of fluorescein angiography, a delay in the filling of the choriocapillaris was observed, very evident at the peripapillary level. The later stages showed progressive diffusion foci in the subpigmentary and subretinal space, with progressive filling of the areas of serous detachment. Thirty days after admission, the vessels had a normal appearance, the detachments had disappeared, as well as the papillary oedema and haemorrhages. Only the demarcation line persisted in the left eye. Focal areas of hyper- and hypopigmentation were observed in the areas where the detachments had previously been present. After three months the patient had recovered, with a visual acuity of 1.0 in both eyes. In the fundus examination only the presence of focal hyper- and hypopigmentation where the retina had been detached was remarkable.   "
"A 72-year-old man diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma and underwent trabeculectomy of both eyes in February 2001 with good blood pressure control. One year later, the patient underwent cataract surgery by phacoemulsification plus posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, which took place without complications, preserving the posterior capsule intact and achieving a visual acuity (VA) of 0.6 in the OD and 0.5 in the OI. Two years after the filtering surgery, the visual field showed progression in the OD and an intraocular pressure of 23 mmHg, so treatment was started with travoprost 0.004% (Travatan®, Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas). One month after starting treatment, the patient reported a decrease in VA in his OD, and the examination was compatible with the development of cystic macular oedema that had reduced VA to 0.2. The diagnosis was confirmed by OCT (OCT 3000, Humphrey Zeiss Instruments, Dublin, CA) which revealed the existence in the retinal thickness of low intensity spaces corresponding to cystic spaces, and an accumulation of underlying subretinal fluid, reaching a thickness at the foveal level of 437 SD 21 microns. Travoprost was discontinued and treatment with oral acetazolamide (edemox®, Chiesi wassermann, Madrid, Spain) 125 mg every 6 hours, ketorolac (acular®, Allergan, Madrid, Spain) 1 drop every 6 hours and timolol maleate 0.5% (timoftol 0.5%®, Madrid, Spain) twice daily. At two weeks, VA had improved to 0.6, and OCT showed normal macular thickness (213 OD 9 microns), with disappearance of the cysts and recovery of the foveal depression.   "
"86 year old aphakic patient after cataract extraction in 1999 complicated by capsular rupture and vitreous leakage. Three years later, she came for consultation with a sensation of a foreign body and photophobia. She perceived light in the right eye and slit-lamp examination revealed corneal oedema in the peripheral 3 mm. Specular microscopy was performed. It was decided to perform penetrating keratoplasty due to the low density of central endothelial cells and the patient's discomfort. The patient's cornea was analysed histologically, confirming the diagnosis of BML and showing detachment and rupture of Descemet's membrane and the endothelium in the peripheral zone, the central zone being normal. At 18 months the corneal button remains transparent, without oedema, achieving corrected vision of 0.2 (due to cystic macular oedema).   "
"A 26-year-old female patient attended our department for bilateral oedema of the upper eyelids, which had been present for 2 years. Ophthalmological examination revealed lesions of imprecise limits (infiltrative aspect of the epidermis) on the nasal part of both upper eyelids, with an orange hue in the temporal area, firm in consistency, and extending along the eyelid crease. They were non-motile, non-painful masses that did not extend beyond the orbital rim. The rest of the examination was normal. In order to try to make a differential diagnosis between entities such as orbital pseudotumour, collagen disease, sarcoidosis, etc., a systemic examination was performed, and all the results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit showed that the masses were practically symmetrical and even infiltrated the levator muscle of the upper eyelid, without affecting the eyeball. Corticosteroid treatment was started (thinking of an inflammatory process located at the eyelid level), with high doses of methylprednisolone (1 g of Urbason®, HOECHST FARMA), which reduced the size of the tumours, but with recurrence of the tumours when this medication was discontinued. In view of this, and not having reached a diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was performed, obtaining three pieces of pinkish-yellowish tissue. Histological examination showed lax connective tissue, almost all of which was infiltrated by histiocytic cells characteristic of xanthogranulomatosis, which tended to form a granulomatous pattern. Immunohistochemical staining for histiocytic cells (CD 68) was positive. This led to a diagnosis of palpebral xanthogranulomatosis. Further tests were performed to rule out multi-organ involvement: abdomino-thoracic CT, cranial and orbital CT, chest X-ray, abdomino-pelvic ultrasound and bone scan with Tc 99m diphosphate. All were normal. It is therefore a case of pure orbital xanthogranulomatosis, or Erdheim-Chester disease, with no systemic manifestations. At present, after a new course of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 80 mg/24 hours, Urbason®) and with a maintenance dose (methylprednisolone 4 mg/48 hours, Urbason®) on a continuous basis, the process remains relatively stable.  "
"A 71-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was referred for a corneal ulceration of probable herpetic aetiology of the left eye of two months' evolution, accompanied by mild ocular pain. The patient reported having suffered ocular inflammation associated with frontal dermatitis, compatible with herpes zoster, two years earlier. At the first visit, she had a visual acuity of 0.4 in the right eye and a finger count at 1 metre in the left eye, a mild bilateral cataract, normal tonometry and fundus without significant alterations in both eyes. In the left eye, a superficial and central corneal ulceration was observed, with well-demarcated infiltrates at the edges, associated with an inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber (cellular tyndall 2+). Samples were taken for microbiological culture by corneal scraping, and oral itraconazole 200 mg/24h associated with topical treatment with amphotericin B 0.15%, cefazolin 50 mg/ml and tobramycin 15 mg/ml was prescribed, based on the main suspicion of fungal keratitis. The culture showed growth of Candida albicans, for which reason the same treatment was maintained. The keratitis rapidly worsened to corneal perforation within 6 days, preceded by a significant increase in pain, severe hyperemia, extension of the corneal epithelial defect, appearance of dense stromal infiltration (necrosis), hypopyon and ocular hypertension. An emergency amniotic membrane transplant (triple layer) was performed, preceded intraoperatively by a new corneal scraping for microbiological culture. The result of this culture (aerobic and anaerobic) was negative for bacteria. Intravenous administration of voriconazole (200 mg/24 h) associated with oral aceclofenac, preservative-free artificial tears and topical brimonidine was started as medical treatment. After 10 days, intravenous voriconazole was replaced by oral voriconazole (200 mg/24 h) and continued for 6 weeks. The clinical picture responded favourably to treatment, with inflammatory signs progressively disappearing during the first 15 days. The patient presented only blurred vision at the beginning of the treatment and a slight increase of LDH in the blood, with no other side effects. Good integration of the amniotic membrane graft was observed, although a penetrating keratoplasty was subsequently required due to residual corneal scarring (adherent leukoma).  "
"A 52-year-old male patient attended the emergency department with loss of vision in his right eye after a week's evolution. His past history included: right nephrectomy for renal carcinoma seven years earlier and right pneumonectomy for pulmonary metastasis three months earlier. At that time he was not receiving any treatment. On ophthalmological examination his visual acuity was 0.1 in his right eye and unity in his left eye; the anterior pole and intraocular pressure were normal. Funduscopy of the right eye showed a uniform whitish choroidal mass at the level of the inferior temporal arcade of approximately four papillary diameters, with associated retinal detachment (RD) involving the macula, with no signs of intraocular inflammation. The left eye was normal. A B-mode ultrasound was performed showing a 3x6 mm cupuliform choroidal mass of medium-high reflectivity, without choroidal excavation. Angiography showed a mass with early hypofluorescence, late hyperfluorescence and a slightly mottled pattern. Given the patient's history, the medical oncology department was consulted and performed the appropriate tests to rule out progression of the process. During this time the lesion and associated DR increased in size, affecting the macula. Initially, radiotherapy treatment was proposed to the patient, but he rejected it and opted for surgery. Enucleation was performed one month after diagnosis. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of renal carcinoma metastasis, without extending beyond the choroid and without infiltrating the optic nerve. During one year of follow-up by the medical oncology department, no progression of the process was observed and the patient only received immunotherapy with interferon. One year after diagnosis of the choroidal metastasis, signs of progression have appeared and the patient has also received hormone therapy and chemotherapy, with no clear improvement.  "
"A 76-year-old male patient came to the ophthalmology department for pain, tearing and discharge in the left eye (OI) associated with severe red eye of 1 month's evolution. A month earlier, the ENT department had clinically diagnosed a suspected mucous pemphigus vulgaris in the throat and mouth, pending biopsy, for which he was being treated with Prednisone 30 mg a day. His general history included hypercholesterolemia treated with torvastatin. Ophthalmological examination showed a visual acuity (VA) of 1.2 in the right eye (OD) and 1.0 in the OI. Biomicroscopy (BPA) revealed a large blister in the nasal sector of the bulbar conjunctiva, associated with hyperemia, which progressed to erosion within 24 hours; the rest of the examination was normal in both eyes. It was then decided to perform a conjunctival biopsy in the office under topical anaesthesia in the area of the lesion. Treatment with gentamicin ointment and fluorometholone eye drops every 8 hours was started. Histopathology revealed a suprabasal intraepithelial bulla while direct IF showed deposits of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the intercellular spaces of the conjunctival epithelium. Upon establishing the diagnosis of Pemphigus Vulgaris, the dose of Prednisone was raised to 60 mg/day, resulting in remission of ocular symptoms after two months.   "
"Triamcinolone-assisted PPV was performed in a patient presenting with dislocation of a lens quadrant into the vitreous cavity with secondary macular oedema in her left eye (LO). Following phacofragmentation, a peeling of the internal limiting membrane revealed marked macular oedema. Due to this oedema, 5 mg/0.1 ml of triamcinolone acetonide (Trigon depot® Bristol-Myers Squibb SL, Anagni Frosinone, Italy) was injected at the end of the operation. After a good immediate postoperative evolution, he came to the clinic four days later with painless visual acuity (VA) loss and a foreign body sensation in the LAA. VA was less than 0.05, with a 3.4 mm hypopyon formed by the deposition of fine crystalline opacities with no signs of inflammation, intraocular pressure of 10 mmHg and a well-positioned anterior chamber lens. The fundus showed marked vitreous haze. The patient's clinical picture suggested infectious, toxic or pseudoendophthalmitis. Given the early onset, the absence of inflammatory signs except for the large pseudohypopyon, its crystalline nature and the fact that the patient had an anterior chamber lens that facilitated the diffusion of the triamcinolone, the symptoms were oriented towards pseudoendophthalmitis and it was decided to monitor her closely with ciprofloxacin eye drops every 2 hours (Oftacilox®, Alcon Cusi, El Masnou, Barcelona, Spain) and Poly-pred eye drops every 8 hours (Allergan, Wesport, Co. Mayo, Ireland). After four days, she was asymptomatic, with bullae in the corneal epithelium and a 4.3 mm hypopyon. As no improvement of the corneal epithelium was observed, a surgical cleaning of the anterior chamber with saline was performed after seven days. Three months later she was asymptomatic, her best corrected visual acuity was 0.3, and the cornea was clear with no traces of triamcinolone in the anterior chamber.  "
"We present the case of a 45-year-old man who presented with bilateral ocular pain, intense photophobia and decreased visual acuity (VA). A fortnight earlier he had been diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis, probably adenoviral, and was being treated with tobramycin eye drops (Tobrex, Alcon Cusi, Barcelona) and cyclopentolate hydrochloride (Cicloplegic, Llorens, Barcelona). She reported itching, photophobia and redness for 3 months, concomitant with asthenia, cachexia and a weight loss of 16 kilograms (kg). His personal history included chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, smoking and a cholecystostomy with percutaneous shunt performed 11 months earlier. Ophthalmological history includes excision of a pterygium in the OD associated with betatherapy 5 years earlier and a posterior sclerocorneal lamellar lamellar graft due to trauma. On examination, the patient had finger-counting VA (cd) at 3 metres in the OD and light perception and projection in the OI. The OD showed intense vascular injection, microcystic epithelial oedema, superior peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUC), 4-cross tyndall and posterior synechia, with intraocular pressure (IOP) of 16 mmHg and a non-relevant fundus oculi (FO). The OI shows a very severe injection of conjunctival, ciliary and episcleral vascularisation, 360º pannus, pterygium, a central corneal ulcer with stromal necrosis, hyphema level occupying half of the anterior chamber (AC) and 360º posterior synechiae, with IOP of 26 mmHg and unexplorable FO. Corneal sensitivity is normal in both eyes (AO). He was admitted to the hospital to start a study and treatment with oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (Dacortin 30 mg, Merck, Barcelona), oral doxycycline 100 mg/12 h (Vibracina 100, Pfizer, Madrid), atropine eye drops 1%/8 h (Atropine 1%, Alcon Cusí), tobramycin and dexamethasone/4 h (Tobradex, Alcon Cusí) and carmellose sodium 0.5/h (Viscofresh 0.5%, Allergan, Madrid). Seven days later the hyphema disappeared, but a level of hypopyon appeared in the OI, so vancomycin eye drops at a concentration of 50 mg/ml/h (Diatracin Injectable 500 mg, Lilly and Dista, Madrid), and gentamicin 14 mg/ml/h (Gevramycin 40 mg injectable, Schering-Plough, Madrid), with negative corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites, were associated. A diagnostic-therapeutic upper conjunctival excision OD ruled out vasculitic lesions or the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2) by immunohistochemistry, showing intense acanthosis and an absence of goblet cells. Systemic examination ruled out any signs of rheumatic involvement, with negative serology for infectious diseases and markers of rheumatic diseases and vasculitis, except for elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Laboratory tests revealed macrocytic and hypochromic anaemia, a pattern of severe lipoprotein malnutrition, hyperglycaemia and elevated liver enzymes. Malabsorption studies revealed mild malabsorption and decreased fat-soluble vitamins [vitamin A: 0.24 mg/ml (micrograms/millilitre) (N:0.4-0.8)], and vitamin A carrier proteins [retinol binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin]. Chest X-ray, cranial and thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) were normal. The orbital CT scan showed mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus with normal ENT examination. Ocular ultrasound ruled out vitreo-retinal involvement of the OI. A diagnosis of calorie and protein malnutrition with vitamin A deficiency was made, and treatment was started with a high protein and high calorie diet without sugar, pancreatic enzymes and oral vitamins. The evolution was favourable, with resolution of the AO picture after 2 months and a VA of 1 OD and of cd to 1 m OI. The OI presents a central leukoma limited inferiorly by a lipid keratopathy and posterior synechiae, which still prevent seeing the FO.   "
"We present the case of a 45-year-old patient admitted to the haematology department for Ig G Kappa stage III-A MM IgG with hepatic infiltration. He had no personal or family history of interest. The patient was referred to the Ophthalmology Department for a red right eye (OD) of 24 hours' evolution with no other visual or ocular symptoms. Visual acuity was equal in both eyes and the slit lamp showed a painless, vascularised, upper nasal subconjunctival mass in the right eye. The rest of the examination, including the fundus examination, was normal. The lesion progressed in 48 hours, infiltrating the upper eyelid and causing ophthalmoplegia of the OD. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed showing soft tissue enlargement without bony lesions. Biopsy of the lesion showed plasma cell infiltration. The patient was undergoing QT with Vincristine, Uracil, Cyclophosphamide, Melphalan and Prednisone followed by Vincristine, Uracil, Adriamycin and Dexamethasone. On biopsy confirmation local RT was added. Despite treatment with QT and RT the infiltration continued to progress through the eyelids and conjunctiva, developing acute post-rabecular glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) of 50 mm Hg which did not respond to oral (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) and topical (beta-blockers and prostaglandins) treatment. RT was discontinued and QT was replaced by Cyclophosphamide, Dexamethasone, Bortezomid and Adriamycin, followed by Methotrexate, Cytarabine and Methylprednisolane. This second line of QT resulted in remission of the infiltration within two weeks, normalisation of IOP with normal visual fields, although with residual ptosis and restriction of ocular motility. Despite remission of the ocular symptoms, the patient died after six months.   "
"A 30-year-old man with legal blindness since childhood, affiliated to the ONCE, who came to the clinic diagnosed with an intraocular tumour. His medical history included hypoacusis; there was no evidence of neurofibromatosis. He had undergone cataract surgery in both eyes and glaucoma in the left eye (OI) 10 years previously. On ophthalmological examination, visual acuity was finger-counting in the right eye (OD) and amaurosis in the OI. He had a pendular nystagmus. In the study of the anterior segment, there was a coloboma of the iris in the right eye, pseudophakia and in the left eye, pupillary seclusion and the bleb of filtration from the previous trabeculectomy. Intraocular pressure was 14 in the OD and 45 mm Hg in the OI. Fundus examination showed a retinal and optic nerve coloboma (NO) in the right eye; fundus imaging was not possible in the left eye, ultrasound showed a retinal detachment and the presence of a mass in the inferior temporal region. An MRI was requested and reported as an increase in the diameter of the eyeball in the OD 32 x 26 mm and dilatation of the exit of the NO; The OI had a size of 23 x 22 mm, and a polypoid lesion was detected in the inferior temporal region of the globe, isointense in T1 and hypointense in T2 with enhancement after contrast, possibly related to amelanotic melanoma, associated with a slight thickening of the covers; in addition there was an extraocular lesion at the exit of the NO cystic, hyperintense in T2 sequence without contrast uptake. With the suspicion of an intraocular and NW tumour, enucleation was performed, which required lateral orbitotomy. Microscopically, an eyeball was observed with a greyish tumour of soft consistency and thickened NO at one of its poles. The pathology study described a proliferation inside the globe and under the retina formed by enlarged cells with ovoid nuclei and fibrous stroma with thick-walled vessels, abundant glial fibres, Rosenthal fibres and microsquamous areas. An image of similar morphology with cystic changes and calcifications was also found in the optic fillet. Immunohistochemistry was positive for S100, neuronal specific enolase, vimentin and GFAP, Ki67 was low positive.   "
"We reviewed in our clinic a young male patient aged 40 years with visual acuity loss in the left eye (OI) of 2 weeks' evolution and metamorphopsia for two years. The patient's best corrected visual acuity was 0.3 and, in addition to myelin fibres in the superior temporal arcade, a MER centred on the macular region producing an image of a macular pseudo-hole was observed in the fundus. A marked distortion of the retinal blood vessels around the macula could be seen. There was no evidence of DPV. The right eye was normal. Flurescein angiography was performed and no macular oedema or diffusion of the retinal vessels was observed. The patient reported no trauma or previous pathology in this eye, and was therefore diagnosed with idiopathic MER and included on the waiting list for pars plana vitrectomy. One month later, he came for consultation reporting a marked improvement in visual acuity and disappearance of metamorphopsia. The corrected visual acuity of the unit improved and in the fundus there was an absence of MER, disappearance of the distortion of the retinal vessels and a dense prepapillary DPV.   "
"A 65-year-old Ecuadorian woman, with no personal or family history of interest, came to the ophthalmology outpatient clinic for a painless decrease in vision in the right eye (OD) of 3 to 4 months' duration. The maximum visual acuity (VA) in the right eye was 0.5 and in the left eye (LO) it was 1. Extrinsic and intrinsic motility was normal. In the OD there was papillary oedema with some subretinal exudate. CT and orbito-cerebral MRI, luetic serology, angiotensin converting enzyme, Lyme serology and chest X-ray were negative. The systemic apparatus study was not significant. Mantoux (PPD), already in the first 24 hours, had a 25 mm induration with areas of dermal necrosis. Chest X-ray was repeated and was also negative. CSF puncture showed an outflow pressure of 16 cm H2O with normal biochemistry and negative culture. CSF electrophoresis was performed and no oligoclonal bands were detected. Urine culture and sputum culture were also negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. Suspected ocular tuberculosis was tested with isoniazid 300 mg/day for 3 weeks with subjective improvement in OD vision although maximum vision was still 0.5. He was treated with isoniazid 300 mg (9 months) together with rifampicin 600 mg (9 months), pyrazinamide 15 mg/kg (2 months) and ethambutol 15 mg/kg (2 months). One year after the first consultation the OD's visual acuity was 0.9 and his examination was normal.  "
"A 72-year-old male patient suffered a severe traumatic brain injury due to a traffic accident, presenting on admission with a score of 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Clinically, he was associated with severe thoracic and pelvic trauma requiring orotracheal intubation and thoracic drainage. Cranial CT showed intraventricular bleeding and a slight right frontoparietal frontoparietal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which evolved as subdural hygromas. There were no lesions in the posterior fossa. The facial CT scan showed a multiple fracture of the facial mass including the roof and medial wall of the left orbit. When the patient left the ICU and was clinically stable, the ophthalmological study revealed a VA of 0.7 in both eyes. Biomicroscopy showed moderate phacosclerosis with no other abnormalities. Funduscopy revealed myelinated nerve fibres in both eyes, normal papillae and no posterior pole abnormalities or peripheral lesions. The study of intrinsic ocular motility revealed anisocoria with mydriasis in the left eye. Extrinsic motility showed complete paralysis of both abducens nerves and the left common ocular motor (including ptosis). Clinically it manifested with torticollis as well as diplopia in all positions, which was disabling. Since none of the lesions described radiologically justified the clinical findings, nor were they amenable to surgical treatment, it was decided to complete the study by means of a cranial MRI in order to find a pathophysiological explanation for the clinical findings. This examination revealed the existence of subcortical petechiae and focal lesions of the corpus callosum, all compatible with the diagnosis of diffuse axonal damage. No structural lesions were found in the brainstem. After four months of evolution, the patient presented a combined paralysis that had not improved clinically. As a therapeutic procedure, botulinum toxin (5 IU Botox) was injected into both medial rectus. The clinical improvement was maintained for three months, after which the symptoms reappeared.   "
"A 76-year-old patient attended the emergency department for right frontal TBI with loss of consciousness, caused by a casual fall at home. The patient reported loss of vision in the right eye (OD) when she regained consciousness. Her medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with oral antidiabetics and osteoarthritis. There was no other personal or family history of interest. Examination revealed an infraciliary incised-contuse wound and a diffuse right fronto-orbital haematoma. Visual acuity (VA) was no light perception with a relative afferent pupillary defect (ARPD) in the OD and 0.6 in the left eye. The anterior pole was within normal, as were intraocular pressure and fundus. Computed tomography (CT) of the skull with orbital slices was normal and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed increased perineural fluid in the right NW sheath. Given the persistence of symptoms, a sagittal reconstruction of the optic canal of the helical CT scan was performed, showing a linear fracture of the roof of the right orbit extending to the lesser wing of the right sphenoid, in the region of the OC, with minimal subsidence of the lateral fragment that reduced the internal diameter of the OC. Visual evoked potentials were performed using monocular stimulus (Medelec® Synergy. Oxford. Instruments, England) with Googles at 2 cycles per second, showing a great asymmetry in the morphology of the responses to stimulation of both eyes, suggesting an absence of conduction of the visual stimulus in the right NW. The patient was diagnosed with traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) with a mixed mechanism of production due to a closed frontal trauma that was transmitted indirectly to the OC and a direct lesion of the NO when the lesser wing of the sphenoid was displaced inside the OC. Treatment with megadoses of corticosteroids (1 g of methylprednisolone followed by 250 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours) was started, without improvement.   "
"A 37-year-old male patient under psychiatric treatment for psychotic disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, who consulted for decreased visual acuity. The anamnesis reveals that in the context of an episode of non-systematised delirium of interpretation, i.e. reading a book on iridology, the patient interpreted that sunlight could change the colour of the iris of his eyes, which was not stated in the text. The patient injured both eyes by concentrating the sun's rays with the help of a magnifying glass during several consecutive sessions for aesthetic purposes. He also self-induced second and third degree burns on the skin of his face and arms in order to make alleged cysts disappear. As a result, the lesions he presented in his eyes were as follows: massive atrophy of the iris with destruction of the sphincter function, solar maculopathy, with abundant subretinal fluid in the macular area and peripheral chorioretinal atrophy with pigment deposition, which is equivalent to photocoagulative lesions. Over a period of eight weeks the macular lesions resolved spontaneously, although the loss of visual acuity has been permanent. Visual acuity was 0.5 in the right eye and 0.6 in the left eye. Both iris and peripheral retinal lesions have remained stable.   "
"A 21-year-old woman consulted for having observed a small lesion on the right upper eyelid (PSD), with progressive growth, in the last four hours. She reported living in a rural house and had previously been cleaning several farm animals. He had no relevant personal or family history. Ophthalmological examination showed a 2 mm reddish insect attached to the free edge of the PSD. Visual acuity was unity in both eyes (AO) and the rest of the examination, including the fundus examination, was normal. Treatment consisted of the application of a swab impregnated with lighter fluid. The progressive release of the jaws allowed complete removal with forceps. The specimen was sent to the Anatomical Pathology Service to verify its integrity and to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine for identification, being reported as RS or common dog tick. The patient underwent an examination to rule out the presence of other arthropods and a study of possible local or systemic complications. Serology for tick-borne zoonoses was performed for six months and was negative.   "
"A 33-year-old woman consulted for a long-standing decrease in visual acuity and severe discomfort due to known dry eyes. Since childhood the patient had suffered from generalised dry skin, anhidrosis, cutaneous piosis, hyperkeratotic skin lesions, loss of scalp, absence of eyebrows and madarosis without alterations in palpebral position. His visual acuity was 20/100 with the right eye (OD) and 20/400 with the left eye (OI). Biomicroscopy revealed mixed conjunctival hyperemia, bilateral corneal neovascularisation involving the entire corneal surface (both superficial and deep) and diffuse superficial punctate keratopathy. Schirmer's test was 10 mm OD and 5 mm OI, with markedly reduced tear meniscus in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in both eyes. Topical treatment with fluorometholone, erythromycin ointment and abundant ocular lubrication was administered. Visual acuity was maintained in the right eye, but improved markedly in the left eye to 20/50. A detailed dermatological and neurological physical examination revealed keratoerythema and sensorineural deafness, and the patient was diagnosed with KID syndrome. The family history was negative for similar problems and there was no consanguinity. Molecular genetic analysis of the GJB2 gene, whose mutation and relationship with KID syndrome has recently been established, was performed and was positive for our patient.   "
"A 35-year-old woman consulted for poor visual acuity (VA) since childhood, without treatment. Examination revealed yellowish hair, eyebrows and eyelashes; reddish skin, no nevi; corrected visual acuity of 20/400 (-9.50 -5.50 x 135º) in the right eye (OD) and 20/200 (-6.50 -5.50 x 20º) in the left eye (OI); exotropia of 50 dioptres, horizontal nystagmus; both eyes (AO) with intraocular pressure of 12 mmHg, normal conjunctiva, cornea with some well circumscribed central and anterior whitish stromal deposits, anterior chamber without cells or flare, clear iris with transillumination, clear crystalline lens and foveal hypoplasia. Based on the ocular and systemic clinical data, the diagnoses of AOC and DG were established and the family was referred for clinical evaluation.  This is a family of nine members, with parents aged 74 and 64 years. There is no consanguinity and they come from different localities. GD is present in the mother, three siblings and their son, while AOC is present in two of the siblings but with no GD data.   "
"A 16 year old female referred to the ophthalmology clinic for visual difficulties, ""like a part of the waxed area that I can't see, especially for the last 3 weeks"". Her mother reports that ""she has gone from being an active child to being slowed down, with difficulty in thinking, speaking and now she can't see properly"". Since the age of 7 she has had epileptic seizures that are difficult to control. Her treatment was carbamazepine, hydantoin and for 3 months Topamax 125 mg a day. The last ophthalmological examination performed a year earlier was normal. On examination, spontaneous visual acuity (VA) was 1 in both eyes, with normal anterior biomicroscopy. Pupils were isochoric and normoreactive. Funduscopic examination showed no abnormalities. Computerised campimetry showed a non-congruent left homonymous hemianopsia. The colour test showed no alterations in either eye. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium was normal as well as diffusion MRI. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. In view of the suspicion of a Topamax toxic phenomenon, Topamax was progressively discontinued, with subjective improvement of the patient and partial recovery of the visual field.   "
"A 24-year-old woman referred from primary care for bilateral loss of vision of 6 weeks' evolution. No family history of interest. Her personal history included treatment with Topamax 150 mg a day for 2 months for epilepsy refractory to conventional therapy. The maximum VA in the right eye was 0.6 and 0.7 in the left eye (OI). The visual field showed a bilateral central scotoma and the fundus showed bilateral maculopathy with greater pigmentary changes in the left eye. Given the temporal relationship between Topamax intake and vision loss, this drug was withdrawn, but after a year of follow-up the patient has not recovered vision, although the process remains stable.   "
"A 13-year-old male is referred for ophthalmological assessment for poor vision. Phenotypically he was a short child with a height of 133 cm, brachymorphy and brachydactyly in all four limbs. The patient had a corrected refractive error of -13.00 -6.50 to 1° in the right eye and -16.00-6.25 to 179° in the left eye. With this correction he achieved a visual acuity of 0.4 and 0.2 respectively. There was no monocular diplopia or findings of extrinsic and intrinsic ocular motility. The horizontal corneal diameter was 12.0 mm in both eyes and the pachymetry was 613 and 611 microns respectively. The anterior chamber was narrow, with bilateral iridophacodonesis. There was evidence of microspherophakia with anterior displacement of both crystalline lenses into the posterior chamber. Intraocular pressure was 20 mmHg bilaterally. Gonioscopy showed a symmetrical narrow angle in both eyes grade II according to Schaffer. The Orbscan-II topography scan (corneal topographer, Baush and Lomb, U.S.A.) and fundus examination showed no abnormalities. To prevent angular closure, Nd:YAG laser iridotomy was performed in both eyes at 10 and 2 hours respectively. Given the stability of vision and the absence of diplopia, a conservative approach was adopted in accordance with the wishes of the patient's family by monitoring visual acuity, intraocular pressure, photographic documentation and visual fields to detect the appearance of glaucomatous damage. On reviewing his family history, the patient was identified as the youngest in a family of eight siblings, in which - in addition to the aforementioned - one brother and two sisters had spherophakia, brachymorphy and brachydactyly. The parents were healthy and none of the children have had offspring.   "
"A 73-year-old ex-smoker with a history of hyperlipidaemia and triple aorto-coronary by-pass surgery eleven years earlier, who was admitted for clinical symptoms of one month's evolution with dyspnoea and angina on slight exertion. For this reason, a coronary angiography by cardiac catheterisation was performed, which showed a three-vessel coronary artery disease with non-revascularisable obstruction of the saphenous bridge to obtuse marginal. Prior to the procedure, the patient was being treated with an antiplatelet agent and had moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine 3.7 mg/dl), which did not contraindicate the study. Since the catheterisation, the patient presented a general syndrome with asthenia and anorexia, and a blood test two weeks later showed a worsening of his renal function, with creatinine of 7.5 mg/dl and eosinophilia of 13%, for which he was admitted on suspicion of acute renal failure due to CES after cardiac catheterisation. Due to the progressive increase in creatinine, he required haemodialysis, and new signs included purple spots on the lateral area of the foot (livid reticularis), a biopsy of which did not reveal cholesterol emboli. Referred to ophthalmology 40 days later for fundus examination, he presented the following ophthalmological examination: visual acuity (VA) was 0.8 in both eyes, intraocular pressure (IOP) was 13 mm Hg and in the right eye fundus (OD) a microhaemorrhage was observed above the papilla and four cholesterol emboli and in the left eye fundus (OI) another two emboli located in the temporal and nasal branch. Subsequently, the patient went into heart failure, accompanied by signs and symptoms of acute peripheral ischaemia, with worsening general condition and progressive obnubilation until his death 73 days after coronary angiography. Necropsy revealed numerous cholesterol emboli in the vascular structures of the thyroid, pancreas, heart, spleen, liver and kidneys.   "
"A 32-year-old man was referred to our department for presenting a pedunculated lesion with a clinical diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma, 1 cm high and 0.6 cm in diameter at its base, reddish in colour, with vascular ingurgitation, located on the free edge of the middle third of the right upper eyelid, with no pain or bleeding, and a year of evolution. The rest of the ophthalmological and systemic examination was normal.  The lesion was surgically excised by making a full-thickness pentagon that included the lesion. The histopathological diagnosis was pilomatricoma due to the description of a solid, encapsulated mass consisting of a mass of pilomatric cells arranged in the periphery, large masses of keratin and isolated areas of ghost cells, with granulomatous reaction to adjacent foreign body. At higher magnification, small basalioid cells without cytological atypia are identified. In the more central area, the cells are larger, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and loss of the nucleus (phantom). Between these two predominant cell types there are transitional cells.  After 4 years of follow-up no recurrence or malignancy has been observed.   "
"A 13-year-old boy was referred for evaluation after suffering ocular trauma to his left eye with a slingshot. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Examination of the right eye was normal and, in the left eye, microhyphema and anterior uveitis were noted. Fundus examination under dilation showed equatorial rounded retinal haemorrhages in the left eye. Intraocular pressure values were normal (15 mmHg and 12 mmHg respectively). The patient developed inferior peripheral retinal ischaemia (demonstrated by AFG) three weeks after the trauma (at this time the patient reported a superior temporal peripheral scotoma) with subsequent development, twelve months later, of retinal neovascularisation in the inferior nasal quadrant. The complete haematological study and blood coagulation tests were normal. In addition, the sickle cell disease test was negative. The microhyphema and retinal haemorrhages resolved with medical treatment (atropine sulphate 1% and topical corticosteroids, eye protection for one week, bed rest for the first four days with gradual resumption of activity, and restriction of salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral administration of aminocaproic acid). Due to the complete resolution of microhyphema in the first week and in the absence of rebleeding, no further studies of less common coagulation disorders, such as factor VIII and XI deficiency or vitamin K deficiency, were performed. Retinal ischaemia was treated with argon laser photocoagulation. After 15 months of follow-up, her final visual acuity remains at 20/20 with no other ocular complications.   "
"A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital in March 2005 for a painful mass in the outer third of the left upper eyelid of 6 months' duration, accompanied by a decrease in ipsilateral visual acuity (VA). The patient reported the development of a similar mass 15 years prior to her admission, which was successfully managed with unspecified medical treatment. The rest of the history was not relevant to the current condition. Ophthalmological examination revealed a VA of 0.7 in the right eye (OD) and 0.2 in the left eye (OI). In the outer third of the left upper eyelid there was a 4 ¥ 3.5 cm painful mass accompanied by ptosis, inferior displacement of the eyeball on the same side. There was a limitation to levosupraversion of the left eye. Exophthalmometry with base 100 was 17 mm for both eyes. The palpebral aperture was 10 mm in the OD and 4 mm in the OI. Left levator muscle function was limited. A CT scan of both orbits with axial and coronal slices was requested and showed a cystic looking temporal mass with bony destruction, invading the orbit and displacing the left eyeball downwards, apparently dependent on the frontal sinus. An aspiration of the mass was performed, from which a dense yellowish liquid was obtained. A smear of the contents showed few Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, accompanied by numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes and abundant mucus. Treatment with oral ampicillin, dicloxacillin and naproxen and topical sulfacetamide was started. The patient underwent drainage of the paranasal sinus contents with removal of the sinus wall. Microscopically, haematoxylin and eosin stained slides demonstrated fragments lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Below the epithelium, the wall consisted of a dense connective tissue stroma with areas of haemorrhage mixed with variable clusters of inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature lymphocytes, plasma cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and numerous eosinophils. The diagnosis of frontal sinus mucocele was established. The presence of large numbers of eosinophils as part of the inflammatory infiltrate suggested a probable allergic or hypersensitivity etiology.   "
"A 24-year-old woman with a history of congenital endotropia and medial rectus surgery at the age of 3 years. On examination she had residual endotropia and DVD. Surgery was performed according to the technique of lateral rectus resection and retoinsertion of both superior rectus loops. Four months after surgery, she presented a cystic conjunctival lesion with signs of inflammation in the upper nasal sector of her left eye. Drainage was performed and a mucopurulent liquid was obtained, which led to a diagnosis of subconjunctival abscess. Treatment was started with topical ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone and systemic ciprofloxacin. After one month the lesion recurred without inflammatory signs and progressive growth was observed. Complete surgical excision of the lesion, which is adjacent to the primitive insertion of the upper rectum, was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was a benign cystic lesion. The study revealed the existence of a cystic formation with a fibrous wall including vessels and some lymphoid aggregates, partially lined on the inner surface by a flat stratified epithelium, with no significant atypia or mitoses. After surgery the lesion did not recur.   "
"Male aged one year and five months, referred by his paediatrician for strabismus. He had endotropia (15 degrees) and small hypertropia in the right eye (OD), the left eye (OI) was dominant. The visual acuity (VA) is low in the right eye (the eye is disturbed by occluding the left eye) and acceptable in the left eye (the eye fixes the gaze and picks up small objects). The light reflex on the cornea leads us to suspect eccentric fixation in both eyes. The child had suffered from febrile convulsions. Among the family history, the mother had chickenpox while pregnant (between 16 and 18 weeks), and a maternal uncle has Alport syndrome. The anterior pole is normal. On schiascopy the neutral point is +2 in both eyes. Indirect ophthalmoscopy shows oval lesions in both maculae, predominantly in the temporal half, suggestive of old retinochoroiditis, with normal periphery. In the OD the macula is larger, highly pigmented and with whitish glial tissue in the centre; the temporal arches are curved towards the pathological area, and there is temporal parapapillary atrophy. In the OI there is well-defined chorioretinal atrophy with pigmented borders, normal retinal vessels and some choroidal vessels over the sclera with pigment clusters; scleral ectasia is seen under the retina. The child has no nystagmus, no other ocular or systemic lesions. The skull X-ray is normal. Suspecting intrauterine ocular infection, serology for TORCH (Toxoplasma, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes), syphilis and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is requested for the child and the mother. Both are negative for toxoplasma (both IgG 0.14 IU/ml, by enzyme immunoassay, EIA). Cytomegalovirus, child negative, mother positive with low titres (Ig G 2.1 Index, by EIA). Herpes type I, child negative, mother positive with low titres (IgG 2 Index, by EIA). Herpes type II, child negative, mother positive with low titres (IgG 2.39 Index, by EIA). Varicella-zoster virus, child negative, mother positive with high titres (IgG 2.68 Index and IgM negative, by EIA). Syphilis, mother and child RPR negative. Rubella, both positive as vaccinated (boy IgG 59.3 IU/ml, mother IgG 113.7 IU/ml, by EIA). Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, both positive, but with low titres that are not significant (IgG 1/32, by indirect immunofluorescence). This rules out an infectious aetiology, as the child's antibodies are not elevated, and suggests that it is a bilateral atypical macular coloboma. As there are hereditary cases (1), the fundus examination of the child's parents and siblings was performed, and all were normal. It can also be associated with hypercalciuria and hypomagnesaemia (2), but in this case the calcium/creatinine index and magnesaemia are within normal limits. Subsequently we have followed the evolution until the age of three years, the VA in the OD is light perception and projection, and in the OI it is 0.2. In the visual evoked potentials, by stimulation with luminous glasses and checkerboard, there is a clear asymmetry, with a detriment in OD. Penalisation with patching was not considered due to the large size of the coloboma in the OD. It would be interesting to carry out an ocular ultrasound scan, but it was decided to wait until the patient was older and cooperated in carrying it out.   "
"A 58 year old patient with no family history of interest and a personal history of arterial hypertension controlled pharmacologically for 6 years and maxillary sinusitis of 10 days' evolution without specific treatment. He came to the emergency department for ""loss and distortion of vision"" in the left eye (OI) of several days' evolution. The maximum visual acuity in the right eye (OD) was 1 and in the OI 0.125, extrinsic and intrinsic ocular motility were normal, the slit-lamp study showed no pathology. Funduscopic examination in the OD was normal but in the OI there was a macular serous detachment extending to the superior and inferior temporal vessels, the optic nerve and the rest of the retinal parenchyma were unaltered. She reported a cat scratch on the thigh of her left leg two weeks before the loss of vision. Seven days after being examined by us, she developed painful erythematous lesions limited to the lower extremities compatible with erythema nodosum, which ulcerated within 20-25 days. The patient was referred to the internal medicine department for further investigation. The chest X-ray was normal, the paranasal sinus X-ray revealed a slight veiling in the left maxillary sinus. Serological studies: ANA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies were normal. CMV, EBV, Rickettsia, Toxoplasma, HIV, Lyme and luetic serology were negative. Mantoux was also negative. Haemogram: Leukocytes 20,670, ESR 64 mm 1 h, CRP 16.4 mg/L. Serological levels of IgM against B. Henselae by ELISA were positive at a titre of 1:812. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin 1 gram per day for 14 days. Four weeks after treatment the systemic picture started to return and the ophthalmologic picture resolved with the OI reaching visual acuity of unity.   "
"56-year-old man with a history of laryngeal neoplasia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ex-smoker and ex-drinker, diagnosed with hyperthyroid crisis. At that time he presented exophthalmos of 23 and 25 mm without limitation of eye movements, visual acuity of 0.7 with correction in both eyes (AO), fundus with mild diabetic retinopathy and thickening of the internal rectus muscles in the orbital CAT scan. One month later he presented with retraction of both eyelids with limitation of upper and lateral motility in AO. Ocular tension (OT) was 26 mmHg in the right eye and 25 mmHg in the left eye. Treatment was started with topical beta-blocker and systemic corticosteroid treatment with 1 g/24 h of methyl-prednisolone iv 3 pulses. Exophthalmos and TO were increasing, so topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were added, and the patient was referred for orbital radiotherapy with 2,000 Gy. The course was unfavourable; proptosis increased to 27 and 30 mm and CT confirmed increased thickening of the internal rectus muscles. There was ophthalmoplegia in AO and corneal exposure in the left eye and bilateral orbital decompression was performed with fracture of the inferior, internal and external walls. Hormone monitoring revealed a severe hypothyroid crisis (TSH 44.5 IUI/mL (0.5-5.0), T3 42 ng/dL (60-180), Total T4 02.4 ng/dL (5.0-12.0), Free T4 0.3 ng/dL (0.7-1.8). The exophthalmos continued to worsen, so a lipectomy was performed on both orbits (1 cc of fat), showing infiltrated orbital muscles and tissues, enucleation of the left eye due to absolute glaucoma, and external and internal tarsorrhaphy in the right eye. Subsequently, thyroid hormones normalised (TSH 14.3, Total T4 5.9 and Free T4 1.1), proptosis decreased markedly and ocular motility increased, opening the tarsorrhaphy. OD examination showed VA of 0.1 as a consequence of severe optic neuropathy, TO of 18 mmHg, and mild-moderate diabetic retinopathy. The patient remains stable after 9 years of evolution.   "
"A 45-year-old woman was referred from the neurosurgery department for sudden bilateral loss of vision after ventriculoperitoneal bypass surgery for a temporal subdural hygroma and cranial occipital abscess. This was the result of a subacute post-surgical complication. A fortnight earlier she had undergone preventive spinal decompression surgery for Arnold-Chiari I malformation. The patient had a clinical history of 16 years, with mild headaches, unsteadiness, rotatory dizziness, self-limited vomiting of variable duration and mild vertical nystagmus for a year. The latter led to the suspicion and diagnosis of congenital malformation, as the rest of his symptoms were related to the ulcerative colitis he had been suffering from for years. Visual acuity (VA) at the first examination was hand movement in both eyes. Pupillary reactions were 2+ with no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was a high-frequency, medium-amplitude downward twitching nystagmus. Fundus examination showed bilateral retrohyaloid premacular and vitreous haemorrhage, confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ocular ultrasound. All these findings were compatible with TS.  A posterior hyaloidectomy was performed in his right eye (OD) after instillation of anaesthetic eye drops and use of Nd:YAG laser 15 pulses (range 4-7 mJ/pulse) in the most inferior part of the haematoma. The posterior hyaloid ruptured and immediately drained blood into the vitreous cavity. A watchful waiting approach was chosen for his left eye (OI). The VA at one year, after several revisions with marked improvement, was 0.6 in the OD and 0.1 in the OI. OCT revealed a premacular epiretinal membrane of recent appearance in his OI. The frequency of nystagmus decreased and the amplitude became mild. Bilateral haemovitreal was still slowly and progressively resorbing. The patient refused any ocular surgery and was satisfied with the visual result achieved.   "
"On 20-08-05, a 33-year-old patient was taken to the emergency department for a bleeding cut on his neck caused by falling over a shop window. In the emergency department an incised trauma was seen in the right antero-lateral region of the neck with a clean dissection involving only the superficial tissues and no apparent damage to the rest of the structures, so the suture was made in planes. On 4-09-06 she attended the emergency department of our hospital for examination of the wound, reporting headache and blurred vision in the right eye (OD). In the ophthalmological examination the uncorrected visual acuity with the OD was 1 and with the left eye (LA) 1. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the OD and 13 mm Hg in the LA. Extrinsic ocular motility was normal except for a right palpebral ptosis of 3 mm with good levator function. The pupil of the OD measured 2.0 mm and that of the OI 4.0 mm. The external examination and palpation of the neck, except for the trauma findings, were normal. A cervical CT scan showed a large haematoma with internal growth that was significantly compressing the trachea, so it was decided to perform an intraoperative exploration and evacuation, where a solution of continuity was observed in the external jugular vein that was leaking into deep planes. Five months later, Horner's syndrome had disappeared.   "
"Woman born at term by vaginal delivery. First child of non-consanguineous parents. Intrauterine detection of mild bilateral ventriculomegaly in the 21st week of gestation, which persisted in successive check-ups. No other incidents were observed during pregnancy. The Apgar test score was 3/10, 4/10 and 8/10 at 1, 10 and 20 minutes respectively, requiring endotracheal intubation in the delivery room. Birth weight was 3480 grams, length 55 cm and head circumference 39.5 cm. At birth the baby had dysmorphic features: coarse fascia, hypertelorism, anteverted nostrils, microretrognathia and frontal asymmetry with left prominence. Generalised hypotonia progressing to generalised hypertonia with vivid reflexes, clonus and generalised convulsive episodes. There is no visual monitoring. During the neonatal period, an electroencephalogram was performed showing a discrete diffuse slowing. Brain ultrasound showed asymmetric ventriculomegaly with left ventriculomegaly and hemispheric asymmetry in favour of the left side. Cranial computed tomography showed prominence of the ventricular system. Magnetic resonance imaging showed cortical dysplasia with foci of nodular heterotopia.  Metabolic and infectious screening is normal. Karyotype 46XX. At 7 months of age she was referred to the ophthalmology department for esotropia of the right eye of 15º. She presented with left eye dominance, abduction nystagmus in both eyes. The retina had a dystrophic appearance with diffuse disorganisation and retinal pigmentary abnormalities. Optic nerve hypoplasia.  Myopia of -13.00 dioptres (-2 to 90º) in the right eye and -14.00 dioptres (-2 to 180º) in the left eye. Optical correction is prescribed. Visual evoked potentials are pathological with an increased latency period. An electroretinogram could not be performed due to lack of cooperation. At 14 months, the large left hemicranial hypertophy made it impossible to wear glasses, and contact lenses were prescribed, which were well tolerated.  At 10 months of age, there was significant psychomotor retardation, hypertonia of the extremities and cervico-axial hypotonia. There is no head control or sitting. Eye contact improves with increased interaction with the environment and social smile. Electroencephalographic controls show an interhemispheric asymmetry of the tracing, without irritative paroxysms. There is a progressive enlargement of the left hemibody, plagiocephaly and lowering of the ipsilateral orbit. Progressive appearance of deformities: tibia vara, coxa valga and bilateral femoral thinning. At 15 months, macrocephalic appearance with involvement of the craniofacial massif. Epidermal nevus and scattered haemangiomas, predominantly on the left side. Spasticity in response to stimuli. At 16 months of age, tracheostomy was performed due to laryngotracheomalacia. He died on the sixth postoperative day due to pneumonia.   "
"This is a 65 year old female patient who was regularly seen in our department after having undergone two operations for retinal detachment (RD) in her right eye (OD) in 1978. The first surgery consisted of diathermy in the upper nasal quadrant where there was a retinal tear and placement of a segmented scleral implant. One month later, after suffering a recurrence of DR, a complete scleral cerclage was placed and knotted in the inferior temporal quadrant and diathermy was performed in this quadrant due to retinal degeneration. The patient had a good postoperative period in which good indentation of the segmented implant and prominent cerclage were observed. Although she had no symptoms, in 1997 the examination revealed scleral perforation with intrusion of the cerclage of half an hour's extension in the inferior temporal area, in an extensive area of chorioretinal atrophy. Due to the extent of the intrusion and the extensive area of chorioretinal atrophy, it was decided to observe the patient.  One year later, the patient underwent cataract surgery in the right eye by phacoemulsification and implantation of a lens in the capsular sac. Seven years later, YAG capsulotomy was performed in the OD due to capsular opacity. The patient came to the clinic one month later with HV in the OD. Ultrasonography showed the HV, the absence of RD and the intrusion of the cerclage. After partial resorption of the HV during the first month, the patient had a new bleed and vitrectomy was performed to clean the blood.  Sixteen months after surgery, the patient remains asymptomatic with no extension of the intraocular size of the cerclage.   "
"A 32 year old man came to the emergency department for a recent decrease in vision in the eye of the left eye coinciding with the appearance of a brownish lesion in this eye. His ophthalmological history included a penetrating trauma to the eye three years earlier, which had been sutured in our centre. On examination, visual acuity was 0.1, which improved to 0.5 with steno-opia. Biomicroscopy of the anterior segment showed an iris cyst occupying half of the anterior chamber, the anterior wall of which contacts the corneal endothelium, a 6 mm linear corneal scar that respects the visual axis and a clear lens. The intraocular pressure (IOP) is 14 mmHg in both eyes. The fundus as far as the lesion can be explored is normal, as is the B-mode ocular ultrasound of the posterior segment. The Stratus OCT image shows a thin anterior wall in discontinuous contact with the corneal endothelium and clear contents of the cyst. The lesion was clinically diagnosed as an epithelial iris cyst. The patient was operated by aspiration puncture of the cyst with a 30g needle, viscodissection of the cyst to separate it from the corneal endothelium and reformation of the anterior chamber followed by ab externo photocoagulation in the same surgical act of its collapsed walls using non-confluent, high power, long term impacts until tissue retraction was observed. No intense burns were performed and no confluent treatment was applied to avoid extensive atrophy of the underlying iris. Postoperatively, the patient had moderate intraocular inflammation that responded to hourly topical corticosteroids and formation of a wide posterior synechia at XII h without cataract development and with significant visual improvement. Six months after the operation, the visual acuity was 0.8 and the biomicroscopic examination showed a vertical oval pupil with posterior synechiae from X to II h as the only sequelae. There are no signs of recurrence of the lesion.   "
"A female patient, seen for the first time at the ophthalmology department of our hospital in 1992 (aged 33) due to a decrease in the visual acuity of her right eye. The initial ophthalmological examination showed a visual acuity (VA) of 0.2 in the right eye (RA) and 0.6 in the left eye (LO), with -5.0 and -4.0 spherical dioptres respectively. Biomicroscopic examination of the anterior pole showed a marked posterior embryotoxon and intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in both eyes. The patient's fundus showed the following features OD: Circumpapillary geographic atrophy of the RPE and choroid with precise boundaries encompassing the entire macular area and allowing visualisation of the underlying choroidal vessels. OI: Diffuse lesions with similar characteristics to those in the OD, with a crescent of atrophy partially affecting the macular area. In this situation, fluorescein angiography (FAG) was performed, showing the atrophy of the RPE and choriocapillaris already described, without clear signs of activity. Given the possibility of serpiginous choroiditis, immunosuppressive treatment was started with corticosteroids and cyclosporine, as well as vitamin supplements for possible nutritional deficiency, but no favourable response was observed. Subsequently, and due to the unfavourable evolution, immunosuppressive treatment with Azathioprine and Methotrexate was reinstated without any sign of improvement. In 2003, and due to her family history (2 nephews genetically diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome without associated ophthalmological manifestations), a genetic study was performed on the patient, discovering the 2785+3 mutation of AAGT in intron 19 of the Jagged 1 gene and thus confirming the suspicion of Alagille Syndrome. At present, and after 14 years of follow-up, the patient has a visual acuity of light perception in OD and 0.1 with eccentric fixation in OI. The fundus examination showed the growth of atrophic chorioretinal lesions that completely covered the macular area without showing any evidence of angiographic signs of activity in the periodic check-ups carried out throughout the follow-up in our department.   "
"A 25-year-old man with macular haemorrhage secondary to ocular trauma. His VA is 0.4 and his intraocular pressure is 15 mmHg. As the size of the haemorrhage was not very large, it was decided to start treatment with topical and oral corticosteroids and cycloplegic. The following week the VA decreased to 0.1 and the haemorrhage increased, so a subsequent vitrectomy was performed, an attempt was made to displace the haemorrhage with perfluoropropane without success and 0.1 ml of rt-PA at a concentration of 50 µg/0.1 ml was administered directly onto the retina and the eyeball was filled with gas (SF6 at 30%) in prone position for 1 week. Four weeks after the operation, the VA was 0.8, the macular haemorrhage had disappeared, but once the blood was reabsorbed, a juxtafoveolar choroidal rupture was observed. At 6 months the VA is 1.0.   "
"A 42-year-old man came to the emergency department with a bilateral and progressive decrease in vision of several weeks' duration. His personal history included chronic hepatopathy due to virus C and an autoimmune Evans syndrome (autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura with anaemia) of long evolution, which had required splenectomy 20 years earlier. Maintenance treatment was 30 mg oral prednisone every other day. On ophthalmological examination, best corrected visual acuity in OD was 0.3 and in OS 0.2. Biomicroscopically, there was a posterior subcapsular cataract 1+ in OD and 2+ in OS. Funduscopy revealed multiple areas of neurosensory and retinal pigment epithelium detachment (RPE) in the posterior pole of both eyes, as well as small, rounded, discrete and sparse whitish lesions in the equatorial retina of both eyes. In addition, other peripheral pigmented cicatricial lesions were present in OS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed detachments involving the macula in both eyes.  Angiofluoresceingraphy was indicated, but was not performed because 2 days later the patient was admitted with a high fever, laterocervical lymphadenopathies and persistent diarrhoea. He was treated empirically with cefotaxime and corticotherapy, but evolved unfavourably, presenting respiratory difficulty with progressive deterioration of his general condition. CT scan showed a large mediastinal enlargement, and biopsy of the cervical lymph nodes revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with CD20+ marker. With the diagnosis of stage II E diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, he received 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy and rituximab. Throughout the chemotherapy treatment (especially from the 3rd cycle onwards), the patient already experienced a clear visual improvement, with progressive reapplication of all the foci of sensory detachment and RPE, leaving retinochoroidal scars with pigment redistribution. Six months after chemotherapy, complete remission of the lymphoma was confirmed by CT and scintigraphy, and the retinas were applied and the old exudative lesions had a cicatricial and inactive appearance. OCT confirmed resolution of the detachments. VA was 0.7 in OD and 0.6 in OS and the patient is awaiting cataract surgery.   "
"A 34-year-old male patient diagnosed with chickenpox three weeks previously, which had resolved without complications. He came to the emergency department with a decrease in visual acuity in his left eye. Ophthalmological examination showed a corrected visual acuity of 1 in the right eye (OD) and 0.6 in the left eye (OI). The slit-lamp study showed a cellular tyndall of 4+ in the OI, keratic precipitates (3+) and no fluorescein staining of the cornea, the OD being normal. Intraocular pressure was 16mmHg in both eyes. Initial fundoscopic examination of the OI revealed mild vitritis (1+) with no foci of retinitis. Topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics was started. Two days later, a slight decrease in cellular tyndall (3+) was observed in the anterior chamber, but fundus examination revealed a peripheral focus of necrotising retinitis in the temporal area associated with retinal vasculitis. The patient was admitted and treatment was started with intravenous acyclovir (10 mgr/kg/8 hours), antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid 150 mgr/24 hours) and topical treatment was maintained. Prophylactic argon laser photocoagulation was also performed around the area of retinal necrosis.  After 48 hours and after verifying a good response with a decrease in the retinal focus, systemic corticosteroids were introduced at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d, showing a rapid improvement in visual acuity, with a decrease in vitritis and a smaller retinal focus. After 2 weeks, antiviral treatment (famciclovir 500 mgr/12 hours) was switched to oral therapy and a gradual decrease in corticosteroids was started at a rate of 10 mgr each week. Antiviral treatment was continued at maintenance doses for 6 weeks, with regular blood and biochemistry tests to detect renal involvement. Six months after the onset of the disease, the patient remained asymptomatic, with a visual acuity of unity in the left eye, healing of the retinal lesions and complete absence of ocular inflammatory activity in both eyes. During admission, recent varicella zoster virus infection was confirmed by seroconversion.   "
"A 74-year-old female patient attended the emergency department because she had suffered an accidental blunt trauma at home, of moderate intensity to the left eye (OI), after hitting it with the edge of the bedside table. His medical history included mild ametropia without optical correction and type 2 diabetes mellitus under treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs. He had no other personal or family history of interest. His visual acuity (VA) was 0.6 in the right eye and light perception did not improve with pinhole in the right eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed haematoma and oedema in the left upper eyelid, intact conjunctiva with intense generalised chemosis, intact and transparent cornea and 100% hyphaema that prevented assessment of the rest of the ocular structures. OI hypotony was observed with an intraocular pressure of 5 mm Hg. Imaging tests (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) revealed an incised upper nasal paralimbal scleral incision wound of approximately 10 mm and the presence of a prolapsed intact lens in the subconjunctival space. The conjunctival chemosis rapidly evolved into generalised hyposphagma, revealing an upper nasal subconjunctival mass corresponding to the prolapsed lens. The patient underwent a 360º peritomy, extraction of the prolapsed lens, suture of the scleral wound and treatment with intravenous and reinforced topical antibiotherapy. One month after surgery, the patient's hand movement VA improved to 0.1 with correction of +14.00 dioptres. The slit lamp showed a clear cornea, upper nasal corectopia with loss of iridian tissue and adherent debris. The fundus, which was not visible due to media opacity, showed retina in situ in the B-mode ultrasound. At twelve months, combined vitrectomy via pars plana and suture of the intraocular lens to the sulcus was performed, achieving a spontaneous VA of 0.3 at eighteen months.   "
"A 63 year old patient who reported a visual acuity (VA) deficit in the right eye (OD) of several months' evolution. His personal history included post-traumatic epilepsy of ten years' duration, arterial hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. He had been treated with 1.5 g vigabatrin and 200 mg carbamazepine daily since the trauma. VA was 0.3 in the OD and 0.8 in the left eye with correction. Anterior biomicroscopy and tonometry were normal. Ophthalmoscopy revealed pallor of both papillae and a macular epiretinal membrane in the OD.  Computerised Humphrey 30/2 white-white and blue-yellow perimetry showed severe concentric campimetric reductions in both eyes (Humphrey instruments, model 745, Carl Zeiss Inc).  She had no family history of interest, so hereditary optic neuropathy was ruled out. The anamnesis and analytical determinations of mean corpuscular volume, vitamins B1, B6, B12 and folic acid ruled out nutritional aetiology. A diagnosis of retinotoxicity due to vigabatrin was established and the patient was referred to the neurology department. At one year of follow-up, the loss of campimetry and VA persisted.   "
"A 62-year-old woman reported multiple episodes of blurred vision in both eyes over the last 13 years, with subsequent complete recovery of visual acuity. The various outbreaks were treated with oral corticotherapy, which was discontinued after the respective remissions. She was diagnosed with serpiginous choroiditis based on clinical and angiographic findings. Her family history includes a twin sister of her mother with a similar condition. She has no personal history of interest. At the last ophthalmological examination, the disease remained inactive and visual acuity (VA) was unity in both eyes despite significant chorioretinal atrophy and scarring in the posterior pole, including the macula. The anterior segment showed no relevant findings and intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. The fundus showed multiple geographically shaped cicatricial lesions, with atrophy and variable hypertrophy of the RPE throughout the posterior pole.  Fluorescein angiography showed multiple mottled lesions due to atrophy and hyperpigmentation, with late stage staining.  Four months earlier, she had begun to suffer from flatulent dyspepsia, vomiting and pruritus. Laboratory tests showed an increase in transaminases (GOT 110 and GPT 90), GGT (gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) 110, hypergamma-globulinaemia (IgG 1620), ANA (antinuclear antibodies) 1/320, negative AMA (antimitochondrial antibodies). HBV surface antigen, anti-HBs antibody, anti-HBc antibody and anti-HCV antibody were negative. A liver ultrasound was performed and was normal. The picture had a good response to calculolytic bile acids. The suspected diagnosis was autoimmune hepatitis. It was decided not to perform aggressive diagnostic tests such as a liver biopsy due to the mild activity of the digestive symptoms.   "
"A 64-year-old man reported bilateral, progressive and painless loss of vision affecting the left eye (OI) for 7 days and which in the last 48 hours had also started to affect the right eye (OD). The patient had a history of heavy smoking and the death of a brother due to pulmonary neoplasia. Ophthalmological examination revealed corrected visual acuity of 0.4 in the right eye and hand movement in the left eye. Intraocular pressure and anterior segment were normal, and funduscopy revealed moderate vitritis in both eyes, with slight hyperemia of the papilla in the OD, and papillary pallor in the OI. It was decided to admit the patient for further investigation, with the initial diagnosis of papillitis with bilateral vitritis.  The neurological examination, blood count and biochemistry were normal. The chest X-ray showed a slight thickening of the right pulmonary hilum, and the cranial CT scan was normal. Lumbar puncture showed only a discrete elevation of proteins. Based on these findings, it was decided to start treatment with corticosteroid boluses and antiplatelet therapy.  Angiofluoresceinography showed hypercapitation in the papilla with no signs of vasculitis. Evoked potentials were normal in OD and compatible with axonal neuropathy in OI. Electroretinogram and brain MRI were normal. Serology, immunology and usual tumour markers were negative. Based on the tests obtained, an infectious, vascular or demyelinating aetiology was ruled out, so an infiltrative aetiology or a paraneoplastic syndrome was assessed. A thoracic-abdominal CT scan was requested, which showed a 3 cm image in the right hilum, compatible with adenopathy. Bronchoscopy showed a widening of the carina, and cytology was negative for malignancy. A PET study was proposed to better assess the lymphadenopathy and a referral to thoracic surgery for mediastinoscopy. In addition, samples of cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and aqueous humour were taken to study the CRMP-5-IgG autoantibody, which was positive in the first two samples. CRMP-5-IgG positivity and the presence of neuritis is associated in 62.5% of cases with the existence of a small cell lung carcinoma (2,3).  Based on these data, it was decided to cancel the PET study and perform a mediastinoscopy, which was reported as a microcytic lung carcinoma. The oncology department classified it as limited-stage microcytic carcinoma and started treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The initial response to corticosteroid treatment was good, improving vision to 0.7-0.3 at 15 days and reaching a final visual acuity at six months, when we considered the study closed, of 0.8 in OD and 0.6 in OI, with an ad integrum restitution of the funduscopic image.   "
"Girl aged 3 years and 8 months. Gestational diabetes and mother Rh - grade A, gestation of 38 weeks and normal delivery. Normal female karyotype 46 XX. Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of this girl shows agenesis of the corpus callosum and multicystic dysplastic right kidney. In the central nervous system she has a choroid plexus cyst and a cyst in the deep interhemispheric region. On MRI examination, no abnormalities of neuronal migration are detected. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were normal. Cognitive studies show a normal psychomotor development quotient. Fundus examination showed a practically normal appearance of the right fundus, with a normal optic papilla, two small hypopigmented chorioretinal lacunae and absence of macular involvement. However, we observed in the left fundus a colobomatous malformation of the optic nerve and a larger number of chorioretinal lacunae without macular involvement.  "
"Girl aged 11 years and 10 months. Normal female karyotype, normal gestation and delivery. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows agenesis of the corpus callosum together with extensive neuronal migration abnormalities. This patient presents with epilepsy in infancy with the first seizure episodes at 2 years of age. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings demonstrate an asymmetrical hypsarrhythmia. Funduscopic examination shows a complete papilla in the right eye, peripapillary pigment and areas of peripapillary hypopigmented chorioretinal lacunae extending into the retinal vascular arcades. However, there is no macular involvement. The left fundus shows a colobomatous optic disc and small chorioretinal hypopigmented areas. There are no other renal or vertebral malformations. The patient is characterised by a long survival, with a current age of 11 years and 10 months, but presenting a very severe psychomotor retardation.  "
"A 43-year-old woman with pain in the ear and photophobia. She had undergone Scopinaro surgery a year earlier, and had a postoperative period with anaemia, varicose veins in the lower limbs, hypocalcaemia and seronegative gonarthritis. Examination of the OI revealed a marginal abscess, diffuse epitheliopathy and conjunctival keratinisation. Corrected VA of 0.6 in OD and 0.3 in OI. After resolution with cyclopentolate (Ciclopléjico®, AlconCusí, S.A., Barcelona, Spain) and a topical quinolone (Chibroxín®, Thea S.A., Barcelona, Spain), the epitheliopathy did not improve despite lubricant treatment (Viscofresh® 0.5%, Allergan S.A.), maintaining a VA of 6/10 in OD and 5/10 in OI. Oral pilocarpine (Salagen®, Novartis SA, Barcelona, Spain) 5 mg every 6 hours was added, without modification of the Schirmer test (2-3 mm in OD and 5 mm in OI). As conjunctival keratinisation and diffuse epitheliopathy persisted, 20% autologous saline was added. In three weeks the tear film increased (Schirmer 5 mm in OD and 7 mm in OI) and the conjunctival hyperkeratinisation subsided, with a final VA of 8/10 in AO.   "
"A 50-year-old man underwent a Scopinaro biliopancreatic diversion in January 2004 due to morbid obesity. The patient presents with hepatic steatosis and malabsorptive syndrome. He is being treated with vitamin B12 for chronic anaemia and vitamin K for decreased prothrombin activity. In January 2006 he underwent pyeloinfundibulonephrolithotomy with postoperative urinary fistula. In April 2006, the patient was referred to the ophthalmology department for night blindness progressive over 3 months. The patient also reported a foreign body sensation and red eye. On examination the visual acuity was unity in both eyes. Slit lamp examination showed a very decreased BUT, conjunctival xerosis and Bitot spots in both eyes. Fine corneal conjunctival epithelial stippling could also be seen on fluorescein staining. In the Schirmer I test under anaesthesia, values greater than 15 mm were observed. Ophthalmoscopically, there was whitish mottling in the mid-periphery without macular involvement. The plasma retinol level was 0.07 mg/l (normal level 0.30-0.8 mg/l).  Given the potential severity of the condition, oral treatment with vitamin A and pancreatic enzymes was started to promote its absorption while awaiting intramuscular treatment, with little improvement. Concomitantly, due to complicated nephrolithiasis (intrarenal abscess), the patient underwent a nephrectomy with severe bleeding, requiring five red blood cell concentrates. After this procedure, the patient reported a slight improvement in his symptoms, despite having stopped oral treatment due to post-surgical fasting. Finally, 300,000 IU of intramuscular vitamin A was administered, achieving an immediate improvement in the subjective symptoms, although the ophthalmoscopic manifestations took three months to disappear.   "
"A 64-year-old male patient was referred to the Ophthalmology emergency department for double vision and dizziness, with apparently no other noteworthy symptoms; however, an instability when standing upright was observed that could not be justified by the diplopia alone. The only history of interest was that the patient reported having been vaccinated against influenza five days earlier. Visual acuity was 0.7 in both eyes (AO), and both pupils were dilated and areflexic, with no previous contact with mydriatics. There was a limitation in the abduction of the AO, greater in the left eye (OI), in the supraduction of the AO, and difficulty in the rest of the eye movements, reporting horizontal diplopia. The rest of the ophthalmological examination was normal.  In view of the suspected diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome, the patient was referred to the neurology department, which detected an ataxic gait, hyporeflexia, and ruled out limb weakness, deciding to admit him for follow-up and a complete study. The results of the blood tests and the computerised axial tomography (CAT) performed in the emergency department were normal. Twenty-four hours after admission, respiratory distress appeared, requiring oxygen and physiotherapy, and in the following weeks he developed new neurological symptoms: facial paralysis, dysphonia and dysphagia. During admission, a lumbar puncture was performed, which detected albuminocyte dissociation, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) definitely ruled out space-occupying lesion or demyelination. Electromyographic study did not provide additional information. The immunological study was positive for anti-GQ-1b antibody, definitively confirming the initial diagnosis. The patient's symptoms improved two weeks after admission, having received two cycles of immunoglobulins. The clinical evolution was slow and polysymptomatic, with diplopia persisting with prolonged limitation of bilateral abduction.   "
"A 94-year-old woman presented with chalazion and unilateral blepharitis of the left eye of 8 months' duration, having been treated topically with antibiotic ointment and eyelid washes. Examination revealed erythematous swelling of the left upper eyelid, hard in consistency, mainly affecting the pretarsal area, with thickening of the affected area and madarosis of the area. Biomicroscopy showed an unaltered ocular surface, with no evidence of conjunctival or corneal involvement. There was ipsilateral preauricular adenopathy. An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed and the pathologist reported it to be a sebaceous carcinoma palpebrae. The orbital computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large tumour of the left upper eyelid with infiltration of the preseptal fat, without infiltration of bone or retroorbital fat. The patient was referred to oncology for further investigation. No distant metastases were found. Given the patient's age and the presence of lymph nodes, palliative radiotherapy was indicated. The local tumour diminished but radiotherapy proved intolerable for the patient and she stopped treatment. One year later the patient died of heart failure.   "
"A 35-year-old male patient came to the emergency department with a severe bifrontoparietal headache lasting 8 hours, which did not change with Valsalva manoeuvres or posture, and partially subsided with analgesics. The patient's personal history included an episode of ICH treated with oral acetazolamide and naproxen, with clinical recovery and disappearance of papilledema. The general and neurological examination was normal, with a body mass index of 22 kg/m2. Ophthalmological examination showed a corrected visual acuity of 0.7 in both eyes. Intrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment examination and intraocular pressure (IOP) were normal. Funduscopic examination showed bilateral papilledema. Fluorescein angiography showed early bilateral peripapillary leakage. Nerve fibre layer study (fast RNFL strategy) by optical coherence tomography (Stratus OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) showed thickening of the fibre layer in the right eye (OD) and thickness at high limits of normal in the left eye (OI). Orbital ultrasound, computerised axial tomography and automatic perimetry were normal. Lumbar puncture was performed, showing an opening pressure of 30 cm of water, with normal CSF composition and serology. The analytical and coagulation studies and the determination of ANCAs, ANAs, PCR, RF, ASLO, thyroid hormones and antithyroid antibodies were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and phleboresonance imaging ruled out the presence of cranial sinus thrombosis, finding a segmental stenosis of the right lateral sinus. The patient was treated with acetazolamide and naproxen and clinical improvement was observed. After venography and cranial sinus manometry, a long stenosis of the right transverse sinus was observed with a pressure gradient of 7 mmHg, of a small amount and similar to that of the contralateral sinus. For this reason, and in view of the clinical improvement, dilatation by angioplasty and stenting was discarded.   "
"A 28-year-old male patient suffered blunt trauma to his left eye during an assault. In the initial emergency examination, a significant reduction in VA was observed in this eye due to hyphema, the IOP was 8 mmHg and Berlin oedema was seen in the ocular fundus. The patient was treated with relative rest, cycloplegia, topical and systemic corticosteroids. After resorption of the hyphema, VA improved to 1, but IOP was 4 mmHg, so treatment was continued with restriction of physical effort, atropine 1% and topical corticosteroids, despite which ocular hypotony persisted (4-6 mmHg), VA was reduced to 0.4 and retinochoroidal folds and papillary oedema developed. The discontinuation of topical corticosteroids did not improve the clinical picture either. The gonioscopic study showed a grade IV open angle without other alterations. Ten months after the trauma, an ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) was performed, which revealed a tear of the iris root in the nasal area with 360° ciliochoroidal detachment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed foveal thickening (326 microns).  Given the lack of response to conservative treatment, it was decided to perform a transscleral contact diode laser cyclopexy using the G probe of the Oculight SLx diode laser (Iris Medical Instruments, Mountain View, California). The procedure was performed under retrobulbar anaesthesia and 2 rows of 10 impacts each (power 3 watts, exposure time 3 seconds) were applied over the area of cyclodialysis described with the BMU. In the first 24 hours no changes in VA or IOP were observed, but from one week onwards a gradual rise in IOP was observed, reaching 12 mmHg by the 6th month, which was accompanied by improvement in VA and progressive reduction in papilla oedema, chorioretinal folds and foveal thickness. BMU showed closure of the cyclodialysis by means of a peripheral anterior synechia and disappearance of the choroidal detachment, justifying normalisation of IOP. At one year follow-up VA was 1 and IOP 14 mmHg.   "
"We present the case of a 24-year-old man who came to the emergency department with bilateral decreased VA and headache of two days' duration. The patient's personal history included a case of influenza the previous week treated with ibuprofen 600 mg. On examination the VA of the right eye was bulging and the VA of the left eye was 0.05. Pupils were isochoric and normoreactive and biomicroscopy of the anterior pole was normal. Ophthalmoscopy revealed greyish-white confluent lesions in the posterior pole of both eyes affecting the fovea. Suspecting AMPE, fluorescein angiography (FFA) was performed, showing areas of marked hypofluorescence at early times, which became areas of hyperfluorescence at late times. Indocyanine green angiography (ICG) shows areas of hypofluorescence in the choroid corresponding to the placoid lesions that are related to the choroidal hypoperfusion that accompanies this pathology. Optical coherence tomography showed retinal thickening with hyperreflectivity in the outer retinal layers. Oral corticosteroid treatment (prednisone 60 mg) was started and continued for one week.  On the other hand, the patient reported a severe headache that improved with corticosteroid treatment and reappeared when the medication was discontinued. Therefore, given the suspicion of cerebral vasculitis, which is sometimes associated with this condition, a nuclear magnetic resonance angiography (NMRA) was performed, in which no signs of vasculitis were observed. A histocompatibility study was requested for HLA B-7 and HLA DR2, which was positive. The patient's visual acuity improved gradually, but at one month's follow-up the patient reported diplopia in distant vision. Examination revealed paralysis of the right sixth cranial nerve, with slight limitation of abduction of the right eye, which was confirmed by the Hess-Lancaster test. An injection of botulinum toxin was made in the medial rectus of the right eye and after a week the diplopia disappeared. At present the diplopia has disappeared and the VA is 0.7 in the right eye and 0.8 in the left eye. OCT shows a recovery of the foveal architecture, but with an increase in retinal reflectivity in both eyes.   "
"An 80-year-old woman came to hospital with diplopia of 7 days' duration. The diagnosis was complete paralysis of the right third cranial nerve with pupillary involvement. She did not report headache, jaw claudication or stiffness in the neck and joints. His personal history was only significant for arterial hypertension. His ophthalmological history was of no interest. Ocular motility examination in the left eye (OI) was normal. The right eye (OD) had palpebral ptosis and limited motility in all gaze positions except abduction. The pupillary reaction to light in the OL was 3 mm to 2 mm, the pupillary response in the OD was slow from 5 mm to 4 mm. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Slit lamp examination was characteristic of bilateral cataract. Fundus examination was normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance angiography did not detect pathology. In the laboratory, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 28 mm/h, C-reactive protein was 0.2 mg/dl (normal, <0.8 mg/dl) and platelets were 175,000/ml3. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies and luetic serology were negative. The diagnosis of TA was considered and a temporal artery biopsy was performed. Pathological anatomy revealed stenosis of the arterial lumen with rupture of the internal limiting and inflammatory and giant cells.  "
"A 67-year-old man with no personal history of interest. He reported that while walking he suddenly noticed double vision and slight eyelid ptosis in the OD, which became total in the following hours. She had no ophthalmological history. She did not report weight loss, fever, jaw claudication or decreased vision. Visual acuity in both eyes was 1. Extraocular motility in the OI was normal. In the OD there was total ptosis with limitation of gaze in all positions except abduction. Pupillary motility was normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg in the OD and 18 mmHg in the OI. Anterior and posterior biomicroscopic studies were normal. Laboratory tests were non-significant with ESR of 21 mm/h, protein C of 0.3 mg/dl and platelets of 125,000/ml3. Definitive diagnosis was made with biopsy of the temporal artery where temporal artery occlusion was found with giant cells around the internal elastic, which appeared ruptured and reduplicated.   "
"A 39-year-old male patient came to the Emergency Department with proptosis of one year's evolution in both eyes (AO), with no decrease in visual acuity (VA). He had no other symptoms of note and no other history of interest. On examination, the patient had a VA of 0.5 in the right eye (OD) (referred to as amblyopic by the patient) and 0.8 in the left eye (OI). Hertel exophthalmometry was 25 mm in the OD and 23 mm in the OI. The biomicroscopic and tonometric examination was normal. Fundus examination showed papillary oedema in the OD. The Farnsworth colour test was normal. In the campimetric study the OI was normal but in the OD there was an inferonasal defect, which was not strictly quadrantanopsia. A computed tomography (CT) scan was requested and reported as ectasia/thickening of the sheaths of both NO in the context of bilateral exophthalmos more marked in OD. Suspecting the presence of bilateral meningocele, it was decided to periodically observe the patient without performing any additional diagnostic-therapeutic act. Today, 16 years later, the patient has a VA of 0.6 in OD and 0.8 in OI. Exophthalmometry and campimetry have remained stable. The papillary appearance of the fundus has hardly changed. He continues with his regular check-ups.   "
"A 37-year-old hyperopic male who, on routine examination, was found to have an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 34 mmHg in the right eye (OD) and 32 mmHg in the left eye (OI). Gonioscopy showed signs of angular closure in both eyes leading to bilateral Nd:YAG laser iridotomies. At two weeks signs of angular closure continued despite the iridotomies being patent and the IOP was 33 mmHg (OD) and 36 mmHg (OI). Ultrasonic biomicroscopy (UBB) was performed and detected an iris-plateau configuration with angular closure secondary to multiple iridociliary cysts. The cysts had thin hyperreflective walls with hyporeflective fluid content, suggesting the diagnosis of primary neuroepithelial cysts.  It was decided to treat the RO by argon laser iridoplasty (impact size 500 µm, 0.5 seconds exposure and 500 mW power). The same approach was offered for the OD, but the patient preferred conservative treatment with hypotensive medication (timolol 0.5% every 12 hours) until the response to laser treatment could be seen. After iridoplasty, BMU was repeated, showing a change in the configuration of the iris root from convex to concave, as well as the disappearance of the cysts. The IOP was reduced to 17 mmHg without treatment.  At one month IOP remained at 18 mmHg in the OI without medication and 14 mmHg in the OD with Timolol. In the BMU, the cysts reappeared in the laser-treated eye, without producing a secondary angular block. This situation persisted for 6 months, after which the iris plateau configuration of the OI reappeared and the IOP rose to 28 mmHg. At this point, it was decided to treat this eye with hypotensive medication like the right eye, as it maintained an adequate intraocular pressure (14 mmHg). The patient declined any other non-medical treatment, as he tolerated the medication very well and adequate blood pressure control was achieved.  Currently, after 12 months of follow-up, the patient shows an IOP of 14 mmHg in both eyes with Timolol 0.5% every 12 hours. The BMU still shows multiple neuroepithelial cysts in both eyes, with no increase in size or number and no clinical signs of angular closure.   "
"A 40-year-old woman was referred to our department for persistence for about eight months of a picture of anterior blepharitis of indolent appearance with the appearance of an indurated nodule in the right upper eyelid classified as ""chalazion refractory to triamcinolone injection"", associated with ipsilateral preauricular lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of the palpebral nodule was performed and reported after histopathological analysis as sebaceous carcinoma.  The right upper eyelid was then completely excised, including the tarsus, and reconstructed with a free graft of palatal mucosa and covered with a pedicled frontal glabellar flap. Border involvement was ruled out in the resected surgical specimen. At the same time, a radical cervical removal was performed due to the presence of necrotic lymphadenopathies in various lymphatic territories. In the same surgical procedure, the conjunctiva was biopsied in all four quadrants as well as the lower eyelid. The anatomopathological study showed no conjunctival infiltration, but tumoural changes in the lower eyelid, so brachytherapy was used for a total of 94 sessions with the isotope iridium 192 at a dose of 0.67 Gy for each session (total dose of 63.8 Gy). External radiotherapy was also associated with the cervical region in order to complete the surgical treatment carried out on the cervical region.   "
"A 64-year-old woman diagnosed with chronic open-angle glaucoma whose left eye was operated on by viscocanalostomy. Her best corrected visual acuity was 0.7 and 0.8 in the right eye (OD) and left eye (OI) respectively. Preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) in the LA was 26 mmHg despite treatment with the combination of timolol maleate and dorzolamide twice daily together with latanoprost once daily. In the OD, with the same regimen, IOP was 17 mmHg. Both in the study of the optic papillae and in the follow-up of the visual field, a progressive deterioration was observed in the OI. It was decided to perform a viscocanalostomy according to the usual Stegmann technique1. We performed the conjunctival dissection with a fornix base and after dissection of a scleral flap that went beyond Schwalbe's line, we created a second, deeper scleral flap, which was removed, where we proceeded to locate Schlemm's canal and carefully canalised it inwards by injecting the viscoelastic. Finally, we proceeded to suture the superficial scleral flap tightly with 10-0 nylon. Twenty-four hours after surgery, the patient had a Descemet's membrane detachment (DMD) in the inferior temporal quadrant measuring 5.0 x 5.0 mm. The space between Descemet's membrane and the corneal stroma had significant haematic and viscoelastic filling. Visual acuity (VA) at this time was 0.5 and IOP 16 mmHg. Treatment was prescribed with mydriatics (cyclopentolate) and topical steroids (dexamethasone) and serial controls were carried out with VA control, biomicroscopy, gonioscopy and intraocular pressure measurement.  Two weeks after the operation, the state of the corneal inclusion remained practically unchanged, with moderate corneal oedema causing a decrease in VA to 0.05, so surgical reapplication was decided using the following technique: A myringotome was used to make an intentional break in the lower part of the descematic detachment and by repeated introduction of air and balanced saline into the anterior chamber, both the viscoelastic and the haematoma were drained through the surgical opening of the descematic detachment. Subsequently SF6 was injected to keep the corneal endothelium in place.  One week after this procedure the DMD was completely reapplied, with radiated folds from the affected area, but with complete disappearance of the corneal oedema, and recovery of VA to 0.8. His unmedicated IOP was 16 mmHg.   "
"An 80-year-old man came to the emergency department with a decrease in visual acuity (VA) in the right eye (OD) of 2 days' evolution. His medical history included: hypertension and dyslipidaemia under treatment, chronic bronchitis and a transient ischaemic accident requiring antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. The ophthalmological examination in the emergency department was as follows. VA by OD: light perception (LP); by left eye (LO): 1; afferent pupillary defect of the LO 3+/4+; intraocular pressure of the LO: 16; LO: 17; biomicroscopy was normal and funduscopy showed a subretinal haemorrhage of 6 × 10 papillary diameters at the level of the posterior pole, including the macular area.  An angiofluoresceingraphy (AFG) was performed, confirming the subretinal location of this haemorrhage, together with an inferior juxtafoveolar hyperfluorescent area at late times, indicating the presence of a neovascular membrane (NVM) at that level.  Two days later, 25 μg of r-TPA in a volume of 0.1 ml was injected intravitreally, followed by a 0.3 ml injection of pure sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and a 0.2 ml anterior chamber evacuation paracentesis. After 3 days, he came for a check-up and it was observed that the blood had partially shifted from the posterior pole, together with areas of fibrin.  One month after this procedure, the patient was seen again with a VA of 0.05 and the funduscopy showed a decrease in the haemorrhage, although the blood persisted in the macular area and fibrin in the lower area.  One month later, the patient came for a check-up and funduscopy revealed a subretinal haemorrhage of similar extent to that seen at diagnosis, so he was diagnosed with haemorrhagic AMD and a course of 3 doses of intravitreal ranibizumab was prescribed.  After the ranibizumab cycle, he came to the hospital for a check-up and showed a VA of PL in the OD and 1 in the OI. Funduscopy revealed the presence of haemolithiasis that prevented adequate visualisation of the posterior pole structures. At the present time, the patient is still under study to assess the next therapeutic step.   "
"A 4-year-old patient referred to the ophthalmology department in June 2008 from paediatrics, with a diagnosis of congenital ptosis of the left eye, which according to the parents had been evident since the age of two. The parents report that she tends to rub that eye a lot. Normal pregnancy, at term by caesarean section. Only the mother's coagulation problems during pregnancy, treated with subcutaneous heparin, stand out. Examination revealed a slight asymmetry between the upper eyelids, with the inner third of the left upper eyelid slightly lowered. No masses were palpable in this area. Visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes with Snellen's E test. Ocular motility normal, Cover test negative. Fundus examination was unaltered. The patient was seen again five months later, reporting itching in the left eye. The new examination revealed a discreet bulge in the inner third of the upper eyelid of the left eye. There was no clear limitation of the motility of the left eye, but it appeared to be slightly hypotropic. The rest of the examination was normal. A differential diagnosis of motility disorder or orbital mass was suggested. An assessment by paediatric ophthalmology was decided and an imaging technique was requested.  In the consultation with the paediatric ophthalmology department a week later, uncorrected visual acuity of 1 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left eye was observed, which at 1.25 at 40o reached unity. Negative cover test in primary position with discrete limitation to adduction and elevation, normal stereopsis and fundus without alterations. Palpation revealed a mass in the inner third of the upper eyelid. During the waiting period until the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, the astigmatism increased. The MRI showed a tumour in the superointernal angle of the left orbit, compressing the eyeball, compatible with a dermoid cyst, and surgical treatment was indicated. An anterior orbitomy was performed through the inner third of the palpebral fold. Intraoperatively, a well-defined lesion was detected in the superointernal orbital quadrant, which was removed in its entirety. One week after the operation, symmetry between both upper eyelids and eye position were restored.  "
"A 35-year-old man consulted for sudden loss of central vision in his left eye. His personal history included having had a common cold for 10 days prior to the episode. Clinical examination revealed an uncorrected visual acuity of 0.9 in the right eye and 0.1 in the left eye, with metamorphopsia in the latter. No inflammatory signs or anterior segment abnormalities were observed. The left fundus showed macular thickening of approximately 2 papillary diameters (PD) with small intraretinal haemorrhages. The right fundus showed a yellowish-white lesion with a papillary diameter temporally inferior to the macula. Additional examinations included fluorescein angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (IGA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), B-mode ultrasound and a complete blood test.  The FFA of the IO shows a pattern of patchy hypofluorescence at very early times, followed by diffuse hyperfluorescence of the posterior pole with a better demarcated subfoveal hyperfluorescent area of 1 PD. AVI shows a hypofluorescent area with poorly demarcated borders in the posterior pole that is maintained with angiographic times.  OCT shows a loss of foveal thickness due to the existence of a subfoveal intraretinal cyst accompanied by small areas of perifoveal neurosensory retinal detachment (DRNS).  Both the ultrasound and the analytical study did not reveal any findings of interest. Given this bilateral, albeit asymmetrical, yellowish-white lesion of inflammatory origin located in the chorioretinal interface, the probable diagnosis was acute posterior placoid epitheliopathy with an atypical presentation. Due to the severe loss of VA, treatment was started with oral systemic corticosteroids administering 1mg/kg body weight of prednisone; a daily omeprazole tablet was also prescribed. After 2 weeks, the patient came for a check-up and reported a very slight improvement in his LAA. The AVSC is 0.9 and 0.15 respectively. Fundus examination showed an increase in pigmentation of the lesions without any other signs of interest. The OCT shows alteration of the subfoveal RPE in the OI, with no evidence of the small perifoveal DRNS described above. The corticosteroid regimen was then tapered.  At 5 weeks the patient showed significant improvement with an AVSC of 0.9 in the OD and 0.6 in the OI. Fig. 5A shows the healing of the lesions corroborated by a control FFA. At the last check-up performed one year after the onset of the episode, the patient's visual acuity recovered completely, with 0.9 in both eyes without correction. The fundus examination showed hyperpigmentation of the lesions corresponding to their scarring.   "
"85 year old patient referred for sudden loss of visual acuity (VA) in the left eye (LA). He was not taking any medication and had no ophthalmological or general pathological history. On examination, he showed hand movement VA (WM) in the left eye. Fundus examination (FO) revealed a rounded, yellowish-white macular lesion with a probable retinal macroaneurysm at the upper temporal limit. It was studied with optical coherence tomography (OCT), which showed a preretinal mass of uniform density, retained by the posterior hyaloid, which corresponded to an accumulation of fibrin.  After discussing with the patient the possibility of performing a vitrectomy to evacuate the premacular fibrin, a wait-and-see approach was adopted. The evolution was good, with recovery of VA with the OI, which was 4/10 at 3 months. When the fibrin cleared, a macroaneurysm was observed in the superior temporal arch. FFA and a new OCT were performed, which showed recovery of foveal morphology, with posterior hyaloid detached. As the aneurysm was found to be patent, it was decided to perform photocoagulation around the aneurysm. Examination of the OD showed no abnormalities.  Photocoagulation caused thrombosis of the aneurysm. The VA of the LAA was maintained at 4/10.  One year later, the patient returned to our hospital, this time for acute loss of vision in the RA. He had VA with MM OD and 4/10 with OI. In FO there was a preretinal haemorrhage in OD. A wait-and-see approach was again adopted, with recovery of VA, which improved to 4/10 in 3 months. FFA was performed, which revealed an arterial macroaneurysm in the inferior temporal arcade OD, while OCT showed detachment of the posterior hyaloid in the macula.  Photocoagulation was performed around the aneurysm, with thrombosis of the aneurysm. The patient currently has a VA of 4/10 in AO, with dense corticonuclear cataracts that will be operated on soon. In addition, a vascular risk study was carried out on the patient, which revealed hypertension and atrial fibrillation, which are being controlled with medical treatment.   "
"A 58-year-old woman diagnosed with seropositive, erosive and nodular rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with high titres of rheumatoid factor for 15 years. She had received previous treatment with different disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs): hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, cyclosporine and leflunomide, which were withdrawn due to ineffectiveness. He followed background treatment with methotrexate 25mg/weekly/sc, prednisone 5-10mg/day variable and infliximab 5mg/kg/IV/8 weeks with acceptable disease control in the last 2 years with low activity without reaching complete remission. He developed septic arthritis of the right ankle with synovial fluid culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Infliximab was withdrawn and treatment was started with intravenous antibiotherapy. After 3 months she consulted for red eye, intense periorbital pain and photophobia. The patient presented with an upper peripheral corneal infiltrate in a crescent shape with extreme stromal thinning associated with scleritis. The culture of the corneal scraping was negative. On suspicion of severe QUP, treatment was started with prednisone 1mg/kg/day orally with no response. Megadoses of methylprednisolone 1g/IV/3 days were prescribed. In addition, surgical resection of the conjunctival tissue adjacent to the QUP and cyanoacrylate adhesive was performed to prevent ocular perforation. The patient responded poorly to treatment, with persistent pain, scleritis and corneal infiltrate. As there was not optimal control of her underlying disease, we decided to start an infusion of rituximab 1g/i.v. two infusions 15 days apart. Three weeks after the start of treatment, there was significant clinical improvement, with an inactive corneal leukoma without scleritis. She is currently being treated with i.v. rituximab on a schedule of RA every 8 months with good clinical control.   "
"A 52-year-old woman with erosive seropositive RA, high titres of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) for 12 years, with secondary failure to infliximab and adalimumab. He presented with red eye, pain and photophobia. Examination: peripheral corneal infiltrate in crescents associated with scleritis. Negative culture of the corneal scraping. We started treatment with prednisone 1mg/kg/day orally and decided to change the therapeutic target to rituximab at the usual dose in RA with methotrexate 25mg/week. After the first cycle of rituximab the patient experienced great improvement with cure of the QUP and went into clinical remission of RA. After 10 months, a corneal infiltrate and mild scleritis reappeared, as well as the onset of joint symptoms. We decided to continue treatment with i.v. rituximab every 8 months with good clinical control of both ocular and systemic symptoms.   "
"A 37-year-old man, former injecting drug addict, was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 4 with a low viral load (75,754 IU/ml). Treatment with pegylated IFN alpha-2b (100µg/week) and ribavirin (1g/day) was initiated. Two months after starting treatment, the patient visited the clinic and reported blurred vision and ""spots"" in the visual field since approximately 10 days earlier. On ophthalmological examination she had a VA of 0.8 with correction in both eyes and multiple cotton wool exudates in the posterior pole. A diagnosis of IFN retinopathy was made and treatment was suspended. In successive check-ups the condition improved and at 3 months she presented a VA of 10/10 in both eyes and in the FO only a cottony exudate was seen in the inferior resorption of the left fovea.   "
"We present the case of a 67-year-old woman who came to the emergency department for bilateral conjunctival oedema of 3 weeks' evolution, after having been treated with artificial tears and topical antibiotic-corticoid ointment during this period of time without improvement. The patient's personal history included arterial hypertension under pharmacological treatment, diabetes mellitus that was difficult to control and recently diagnosed oral candidiasis. Ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral conjunctival chemosis with intense tearing, and the rest of the ophthalmological examination was normal. The patient reported having lost 5 kg in the last 2 weeks, a feeling of generalised swelling, especially in the face, together with asthenia and generalised pruritus.  After a systemic examination she was diagnosed with suspected Cushing's syndrome. Hormonal tests revealed an ACTH of 3 pg/mL (normal 10-55), basal plasma cortisol of 35.3 mcg/dL and urinary free cortisol (UFC) of 632 mcg/24h (normal < 180). Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) were normal. Abdominal CT scan showed a left adrenal mass measuring 8.2×5.4cm, suggestive of adrenal carcinoma, with no locoregional adenopathies.  Given the clinical evolution, it was decided to start treatment with ketoconazole 400mg/day prior to surgery in order to inhibit adrenal cortisol secretion, and the adrenal tumour was excised together with dissection of the surrounding fat, with complete resolution of the chemosis.  The histology of the adrenal tumour was reported as ""adrenocortical carcinoma with extensive zone of necrosis with proliferative activity, infiltrating the surrounding capsule and invading the pericapsular lymphatic vessels"". After an initial course of chemotherapy with cisplatin-etoposide, he was diagnosed 3 months later with multiple bilateral pulmonary metastases in both hemithoraxes and a local recurrence at the left adrenal level by means of a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan, for which he received three cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and vincristine, without improvement, with progression of respiratory and cardiac insufficiency, starting treatment with weekly taxol for 2 months (antineoplastic chemotherapy), dying due to the progressive respiratory insufficiency he presented.   "
"A 26-year-old man with a decrease in visual acuity (VA) in the left eye (LA) of two years' evolution. Carrier of the causal mutation of VHL disease, father and brother with systemic manifestations of the syndrome. On examination, the VA of the LA is 0.4. The left fundus showed an orange endophytic tumour of two papillary diameters in the superior temporal arcade with dilated nutrient vessels. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed diffuse cystic oedema in the posterior pole and angiography (AFG) showed early hyperfluorescence of the lesion with late leakage. A systemic study was requested, which also showed multiple solid nodules in both kidneys suggestive of bilateral hypernephroma (later confirmed after radical left nephrectomy), a hypercapillary nodule in the right adrenal gland, a probable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour and multiple haemangioblastomas in the pons and spinal cord, with mild associated medullary oedema.  Argon laser photocoagulation was started in two sessions during which subretinal haemorrhage along the vascular arcade and vitreous haemorrhage (VH) occurred. Two months later, in the absence of reabsorption of the VH, a 23G vitrectomy was performed, during which treatment of the lesion was completed using an endolaser. Three months after surgery, VA was 0.6. OCT reveals a good foveal profile, with resolution of macular oedema. The AFG confirms the closure of the nutritional vessels, the lesion has a cicatricial appearance, and although it captures early on, there is no leakage, with replacement vessels being seen in the periphery of the lesion.   "
"An 83-year-old man with advanced Alzheimer's disease, insulin-dependent diabetic of 35 years' duration, who attended our emergency department for ocular pain in the right eye of 2 days' duration. VA could not be measured due to lack of cooperation. Evaluation of the anterior segment revealed a corneal ulcerative lesion 2.5mm in diameter with a central perforating endothelial pore of approximately 1mm, with no concomitant infectious or inflammatory process. The patient had no history of trauma. With the diagnosis of a sterile non-traumatic corneal perforation, the lesion was urgently closed. Under topical anaesthesia and in the operating theatre to facilitate collaboration, a Tachosil® patch was prepared and cut in such a way that it went beyond the edges of the ulceration for complete coverage. After hydration with saline for 5 seconds, the active part (yellow part) was immediately applied to the corneal defect, pressing and gently moulding the sponge for 3 minutes with forceps to ensure that it was firmly attached to the lesion.  Without removing the excess material, the eye was occluded. On uncovering, after about 36 hours of occlusion, it was observed that there were no sponge remnants in the area of application and a fibrinoid material occluded the perforating endothelial pore. No sponge debris was found to be displaced or in the conjunctival fornices. A therapeutic lens was applied for safety and topical antibiotic, cycloplegic and medroxyprogesterone treatment was started. Seventy-two hours after application, corneal thinning persisted over the perforation area, with complete closure and good anterior chamber depth. Subsequent controls at one week and one month confirmed total corneal closure and the therapeutic lens and the medical treatment described could be removed.   "
"A term newborn girl was referred for ophthalmological assessment at 20 days of life due to the appearance of occasional nystagmus. Her mother, with no significant history during pregnancy, had undergone glaucoma surgery at 20 years of age with bilateral trabeculectomy and reconstructive surgery for syndactyly of the hands. Ophthalmological examination revealed microcorneas with discreetly veiled appearance, occasional horizontal nystagmus, bilaterally increased digital ocular tone and fundus with preserved papillae; and general physical examination revealed a narrow nasal pyramid with narrow nostrils and thin nasal wings, mild micrognathia and syndactyly of the fourth and fifth fingers of both hands. Under sedation, tonometry revealed intraocular pressure (IOP) of 35 and 40mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively, and epithelial oedema and superficial corneal clouding.  Bilateral trabeculectomy was performed with good postoperative IOP control, without the need for additional topical drugs. At the last ophthalmological examination, at 14 months of age, the patient was in orthotropia, with good fixation and light tracking, refractive defect of -4 dioptres in both eyes, diffuse blisters and no inflammatory signs, and good IOP control was confirmed. No alterations of interest were found in the FO.   "
"The first case is that of a 9-year-old girl who reported blurred vision. Her visual acuity was 0.2 and 0.3 according to the Snellen optotype, respectively. Her refraction was determined under cycloplegia to rule out refractive defects and was +0.75 in both eyes. The rest of the ophthalmological examination was normal, with a stereopsis of 60""-40"". Further anamnesis revealed that the patient was a girl adopted at the age of 7 years. While she was drawing in the consulting room, it was observed that she had no difficulty in handling herself, even dilated, so that the symptoms seemed disproportionate and a simulation was suspected. A mirror test was used, and the result was that the 0.4 line was seen with both eyes. Considering that flat mirrors have the property of doubling distances, her real acuity would correspond to 0.8. The case was discussed with the parents and it was decided to carry out regular check-ups. His acuity improved to unity with both eyes at 3 months.   "
"The second case is that of a 10-year-old girl who was referred from another centre for low vision with no apparent organic cause. The patient presented a report showing a visual acuity of 0.01 in both eyes with a refraction under cycloplegia of +1.00. All ophthalmological examinations were normal. The complementary tests presented visual evoked potentials (VEP), electroretinogram (ERG), angiofluoresceingraphy (AFG), computerised axial tomography (CAT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed no alteration. Given the suspicion of simulation, we investigated the patient's family, school and social situation. She was the youngest of 4 siblings, with a large age difference, and in recent months she had begun to behave badly, with low grades at school, difficulty integrating with her classmates and, in addition, a sprain that forced her to use crutches. It was decided to carry out the lens confusion test: a +6.00 lens was placed in a trial frame and then progressively neutralised with negative lenses. Monocular VA was 0.8 and 0.6, respectively; and 0.8 in binocular vision. Stereopsis values were normal, 40"". The parents were reassured about the child's condition and she was referred back to her referral centre for follow-up and monitoring.   "
"Male infant aged 6 months (affected) and heterozygous in his mother who was seen in our clinic for presenting divergent strabismus with absence of fixation in the left eye. Both pregnancy and delivery had passed without complications. As personal history, the infant had been involved in a traffic accident the previous month. On examination the anterior pole was normal in both eyes. In the left fundus there was an inferior retinal detachment associated with a vitreous veil with retinal traction up to the papilla.   No retinal changes were observed in the right fundus. Retinoscopy showed a neutral point of +3.00 -2.00 at 10o in the right eye and +3.50 +0.50 at 7o in the left eye. Given the history of the traffic accident, a traumatic origin was attributed to the retinal detachment in the left eye. Periodic check-ups were carried out. The retinal detachment evolved towards complete resorption, with a demarcation line appearing in the temporal retina. The macula adapted, presenting an alteration at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.   After a few months, vitreous flanges were observed in the inferior temporal arcade in the right eye. This led to the possibility of peripheral retinoschisis as the origin of the retinal detachment in the left eye. Both macular OCT and ERG were performed, but the results could not be assessed in both tests due to the patient's poor cooperation given his young age. A DNA study was therefore performed on a peripheral blood sample. A mutation (Q154R) was observed in exon 5 of the XLRS gene responsible for X-linked retinoschisis. The mutation was present in hemizygosis in the patient (affected) and in heterozygosis in his mother (carrier). At the age of 6 years, visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye, despite prolonged treatment with hourly occlusions of the right eye. Examination revealed inferior temporal vitreous condensation in the right eye and inferior temporal peripheral retinoschisis in the left eye, associated with residual fibrosis of the inferior temporal arcade.   The absence of foveal schisis was noted by OCT in both eyes.  "
"A 52-year-old woman reported a spontaneous decrease in visual acuity (VA) in her amblyopic left eye (LO). She had no history of premature birth or family history of ocular disease. At the first examination, the best corrected VA was 1 in the right eye (OD) (-1 cylinder 150o +3 sphere; axial length 22.5mm) and 0.025 in the left eye (OI) (-0.75 cylinder 25o -13.25 sphere; axial length 25.3mm). Biomicroscopic study of the OI identified the Mittendorf's spot located in the lower nasal quadrant of the posterior lens capsule and the anterior end of the AHP with haematic content inside. The oleophilic eye was normal. Horizontal corneal diameters measured 12mm in both eyes (AO) and applanation tonometry was 18mm Hg in AO.  Indirect ophthalmoscopy of the OI showed diffuse mild intravitreal haemorrhage. The path of the AHP could be followed from the optic nerve to the posterior crystalloid. The artery, fixed at both ends, moved freely with eye movements. The posterior vitreous was partially detached from the retina. There were no peripheral retinal abnormalities, no signs of vitreoretinal traction or retinal detachment. The fundus of the OD was normal.  The haemorrhage gradually resorbed over a week. The AHP could be distinguished more clearly allowing a better anatomical study. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed the morphological features of Bergmeister's papilla. From this, the AHP emerged showing a tubular structure with a hyporeflective interior.  B-mode ultrasound showed a linear hyperechogenic image with respect to the vitreous corresponding to the AHP and a partial posterior vitreous detachment. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated normal blood flow in the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary arteries but no active blood flow in the AHP.  The haemogram and specific coagulation tests were normal. The haemovitreous was completely reabsorbed and the patient recovered the 0.2 vision she had before the haemorrhage due to anisometropic amblyopia. There was no recurrence of bleeding in 6 months of follow-up.   "
"A 75-year-old man, diagnosed with primary bilateral lipoid keratopathy, who reported progressive loss of visual acuity (VA). Ophthalmological examination showed VA of 20/60 in the right eye (OD) and hand movement in the left eye (OI). Biomicroscopy showed a yellowish-white corneal opacity in the full thickness of the stroma, incomplete annular shape, respecting the visual axis in the right eye and affecting the central cornea in the left eye. Superficial and deep neovascularisation extending to the centre of the cornea was also observed. Serum lipid levels were normal. The patient underwent surgery and underwent penetrating keratoplasty with extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation in the OI. Postoperative treatment included topical steroids and antibiotics: 4 times/day (Tobradex®, Alcon-Cusí, Barcelona, Spain), topical cyclosporine 2%: 4 times/day and oral prednisone: 50mg/day, in a descending pattern for 2 weeks.  At 1 month, biomicroscopy revealed deep corneal neovascularisation extending over the bed and graft-host interface at 3 and 6 hours, with a whitish opacity around the vessels. After obtaining informed consent for compassionate use medication, topical treatment with bevacizumab (25mg/ml) was started: 4 times/day/2 months, in a descending pattern for 6 months. At 8 months, the patient was maintained on topical bevacizumab: 1x/day. Fig. 1C shows partial regression of corneal neovascularisation with clear graft. His VA was 20/40.   "
"A 66-year-old woman was referred to our department for uveitis in the right eye which had been present for a year. The patient reported decreased vision in this eye but no myodesopsia or metamorphopsia. Her medical history included an intracranial haemorrhage twelve years ago, which required surgery and transfusion of two units of red blood cell concentrate. In the ophthalmological examination, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 8/20 in the right eye and 10/20 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination showed cellular debris in the vitreous with no signs of activity. Fundus examination showed epimacular membrane in both eyes, no signs of retinal vasculitis, snowballs or snowbanks. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the epimacular membrane. Intermediate uveitis of unknown aetiology was diagnosed.  In the following months the patient developed progressive weakness in the lower limbs and became unable to walk. She also consulted for an episode of vitritis ++ that subsided with transseptal triamcinolone (TRIGON depot). In the aetiological study, after ruling out other causes of the neurological symptoms, with normal MRI, given the association of uveitis and idiopathic myelopathy with patellar hyperreflexia, serology was requested for VLHT-1, which was positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of antibodies against VLHT-1 (ABBOTT HTLV-1/HTLV-2, Innogenetics N.V.). EIA samples were tested by strip immunoblot (INNO-LIATM HTLV I/II, Innogenetics N.V.) which confirmed the presence of antibodies to HTLV-1. The diagnosis of tropical spastic paraparesis and intermediate uveitis due to HTLV-1 was then established. Treatment with oral prednisone was prescribed, improving his neurological symptoms as well as his CVAM, reaching a vision of 14/20 in the right eye and 18/20 in the left eye.   "
"A 62-year-old man presented with a painless decrease in visual acuity (VA) in the left eye (LA) of 2 days' duration. He had been seen 2 months previously for red eye, diagnosed with conjunctivitis, and treated with a fixed combination of dexamethasone and tobramycin. At that time VA was 1 and IOP 14mmHg in both eyes. Personal history was diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, hepatic steatosis, hyperthyroidism, ischaemic heart disease and renal transplantation for chronic renal failure secondary to chronic pyelonephritis. His systemic medical treatment included prednisone 5mg/24h (Prednisone Alonga®, Sanofi Aventis), tacrolimus (Prograf®, MSD) and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®, Roche). Initial examination was VA of 1 in the right eye (RA) and 0.1 in the LA, normal biomicroscopy in the RA, in the LA there was intense conjunctival injection and central predominantly tarnished cornea with mild oedema and negative fluorescein staining, without Tyndall, synechiae, keratic precipitates or secretion. IOP was 18mmHg in OD and 46mmHg in OI. The fundus was difficult to visualise due to corneal oedema, but the papilla and macula were normal, with an applied retina and no peripheral lesions. On gonioscopy the angle was open, with no synechiae or neovessels. During the examination, the patient's somnolence and some respiratory difficulty were striking. He was also short, moderately obese and had a short neck. The initial diagnosis was ocular hypertension in OI, and treatment was started with the fixed combination of brimonidine 0.2% and timolol maleate 0.5% (Combigan®, Allergan). He was referred to the glaucoma clinic and the pulmonology department, which subsequently diagnosed severe apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome. One week later, VA was still 0.1 and conjunctival hyperemia, mild corneal oedema, mild superficial punctate keratitis, with IOP of 40mmHg persisted. Pachymetry was 512µm in OD and 574µm in OI (increase justified by corneal oedema). A differential diagnosis with a carotid-cavernous fistula or an orbital apex syndrome was suggested, and a computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan was requested. Treatment was changed to brinzolamide (Azopt®, Alcon Cusi), tafluprost (Saflutan®, MSD) and diclofenac sodium (Diclofenac-lepori®, Angelini Farmaceutica). Two days later, IOP was still at 30mmHg, so acetazolamide (Edemox®, Chiesi-Spain) and prednisone 60 mg (Prednisone Alonga®, Sanofi Aventis) were added orally.  Hyperemia progressively decreased, and corticosteroids were gradually reduced, but IOP remained above 26mmHg. CT ruled out any orbital and/or cranial disease. At 5 weeks, a peripheral ulcer of pseudodendritic appearance with positive fluorescein staining and infiltration of the edges appeared; corneal scraping was performed for culture and detection of C-reactive protein of herpes virus and treatment was started with topical (Zovirax®, Glaxo Smith Kline) and oral (Virex®, Biogen) acyclovir. Microbiological analysis confirmed positivity for HVS. With this treatment, the corneal lesion healed leaving a small peripheral leukoma, IOP normalised and visual acuity reached 0.8.   "
"A 29-year-old man consulted for several weeks for peripheral vision disturbances associated with manifestations of pituitary hypofunction. On examination he had a visual acuity (VA) of 1 in both eyes (AO), with normal anterior pole, intraocular pressure and fundus (FO). The visual field (VF) (Octopus 1-2-3 programme G1X) showed a superior arcuate defect with some peripheral changes in the right eye (RA) and a superior altitudinal defect and peripheral defects in the left eye (LO).  Urinalysis revealed hypodensity of practically water and hormone function studies showed undetectable FSH and LH, testosterone and growth hormone at below normal levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed dilatation of the left lateral ventricle, periventricular involvement of the third ventricle, the hypothalamus, as well as the region of the chiasm and contrast-enhancing optic nerves, compatible with granulomas in the aforementioned locations.  In the thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed axial tomography (CT) with contrast, numerous lymph nodes were observed at the cervical, bilateral supraclavicular, bilateral axillary and also at the thoracic and pelvic levels. A deep axillary adenopathy was biopsied and was found to be compatible with sarcoidosis. The patient was diagnosed with systemic sarcoidosis with central nervous system involvement, involvement of the chiasm, optic nerve, hypothalamic-pituitary axis with panhypopituitarism (hypogonadism, hypocorticism, decreased growth and antidiuretic hormones). Treatment was started with methylprednisolone pulses 1g/d for 3 days, and vasopressin. At one and four years the patient was stable and hormonally controlled. The CV alterations were permanent but stable and non-progressive.  VA was 1 in AO and the fundus showed a slightly verticalised papilla with pallor in the temporal region accompanied by peripapillary atrophy in OD and total pallor and temporal peripapillary atrophy in OI, physiological AO excavation. OCT showed a decrease in the nerve fibre layer in the upper, nasal and lower quadrant in OD and in all sectors of the OI. The visual evoked potentials with damer (PVE-pattern) showed a decrease in all recorded responses and a slight increase in latencies when stimulating the RO.   "
"A 69-year-old man with a personal history of M1 AML (myeloblastic without differentiation), in complete remission (CR) for 11 months after chemotherapy treatment according to the PETHEMA-LAM 99 protocol. In February 2008 he was admitted for catarrhal respiratory symptoms, with severe nasal congestion, with no response to antibiotics. He also presented erythematous papules on his back, supraclavicular and submaxillary adenopathies. The patient was referred by the haematologist for presenting red eye of two days' evolution, with no other ocular symptoms. On examination he had a corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in OD and 18/20 in OI. Ocular reflexes, motility and tonometry were normal. Anterior pole biomicroscopy showed a salmon-coloured raised fleshy lesion on the upper and lower tarsus in OD. In the OI, a similar lesion was found in the inferior tarsal conjunctiva. No alterations were observed in the fundus.  The possibility of leukaemic involvement of the conjunctiva was considered and a biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histology showed a diffuse proliferation of myeloid cells arranged under the conjunctival epithelium, which were immunohistochemically positive for myeloperoxidase and CD43, negative for B and T cell markers (CD20, CD3, CD5), as well as for TdT, CD34 and CD117, and the case was diagnosed as a granulocytic sarcoma.  New biopsies confirmed the involvement of the nasal mucosa and skin. Based on these findings, the diagnosis was SM affecting conjunctiva, skin and nasal mucosa. However, no relapse was observed in peripheral blood and bone marrow smears, so it was considered that CR persisted at this level. Lumbar puncture and all other examinations were normal. Following the diagnosis of extramedullary recurrence in the form of SM of AML, second-line treatment was started according to the FLAG-IDA protocol with a good response of the infiltrative lesions. The patient died in May 2008, three months after the diagnosis of SM, due to multi-organ failure.   "
"A 52-year-old woman came to the emergency department for sudden and painless loss of vision in the left eye (OI). She had no relevant personal or family history. On ophthalmological examination, her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the right eye (RA) was 0.9 and in the LA 0.6. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and biomicroscopy (BMC) of the anterior pole showed no significant alterations. Fundus visualisation (FO) showed a brownish mottling, more prominent temporal to the fovea, corresponding to the typical ""orange peel fundus"" image. There were also characteristic angioid striae (AE), as well as colloid bodies in both eyes (AO). In his OI, there were striking drusen of the optic nerve and a subfoveal greyish lesion within an elevated AE, bordered by haemorrhages, compatible with CNV.  A series of complementary tests were therefore performed, showing diffuse hyperautofluorescent mottling (hyper-FA) and irregular linear hypoautofluorescent lesions (hypo-FA) with hyper-FA mottling in their bed in the fundus autofluorescence (FA) of the AO. In the OI, optic nerve drusen and colloid bodies with intense hyper-FA were prominent. Fluorescein angiography (FAG) revealed a hyper- and hypofluorescent lattice due to alteration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and a hyperfluorescent lesion with late diffusion in the LA compatible with CNV. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a destructuring of the EPR-choriocapillary hyperreflective band in the AO, and in the OI a dense cupuliform lesion (CNV), bordered by a small detachment of neuroepithelium. After ophthalmological diagnosis, she was referred to the elastic pseudoxanthoma unit of our hospital, where the disease was confirmed. Treatment was prescribed with monthly intravitreal injections of 0.05ml of ranibizumab (Lucentis) for 3 months in her OI, with measurement of the MAVC and OCT one month after each injection, and control AFG at 3 months. Periodic follow-up OCT scans were performed for a follow-up period of one year. At 3 months, a clear improvement in the condition was observed, as the MAVC improved to 0.7, subretinal haemorrhages disappeared and macular thickness decreased on OCT.  "
"A 58-year-old man presented with sudden loss of vision in his left eye. The patient had been under follow-up by Internal Medicine and Dermatology for 12 years due to PXE. His MAVC in the OD was 0.6 and in the OI 0.4. No alterations were found in IOP or anterior pole CMB. The FO examination revealed bilateral AEs. In the OD, there was a raised yellowish-grey gliotic lesion and, in the OI, a pigmented triradiate image bordered by orange areas in the macular area, together with a small juxtafoveal lesion, somewhat greyish and slightly raised, surrounded by abundant subretinal haemorrhages, mainly nasal. Suspicion of CNV membrane within a ""reticular pattern"" retinal dystrophy led us to perform an AFG, where a gliotic eschar was observed in the OD and, in the OI, a hypofluorescent image in the form of a reticulum, in the upper area of which there was a hyperfluorescent lesion with lacy borders that increased in intensity and size in the late stages, thus confirming the previous suspicion. OCT corroborated the diagnosis, showing a discrete elevation of the EPR-choriocapillary band.  The FA of the LA revealed a curious image, as the dystrophy in pattern appeared as the negative of the angiographic image; in other words, the reticulum, which angiographically appeared hypofluorescent, was intensely hyper-FA in FA due to the alteration of the EPR at that level. In this case, the same treatment as in the previous patient was applied according to the protocol described above. A higher VA was achieved, reaching 0.7. Progressive OCT scans showed a progressive decrease in macular thickness and the control AFG showed an improvement in the condition.   "
"A 32-year-old man with colon neoplasia with hepatic, retroperitoneal and mediastinal metastases, with a rapid evolution on a background of ulcerative colitis. A week after diagnosis, despite presenting an advanced stage, he was admitted for surgery with partial tumour resection, and postoperative chemotherapy treatment was started with different consecutive lines of therapy: oxaliplatin+folinic acid+fluorouracil, capecitabine+oxaliplatin, and capecitabine+irinotecan, with no response. The K-ras gene was even determined for possible treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab, which was negative and therefore ruled out this therapeutic alternative. Furthermore, treatment with bevacizumab was not advisable as the patient presented with drainage in the abdominal cavity, with production of purulent material. Fifteen days after surgery, the patient reported moderate pain in the left eye, for which reason he requested a consultation with our department. On ophthalmological examination, the patient presented moderate eyelid oedema, conjunctival chemosis, severe non-reducible exophthalmos, complete ptosis in the left eye, and limited ocular motility in all gaze positions, but especially in lateral gaze and supraversion. Cranial and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested, with T1-weighted images and axial diffusion-weighted and FLAIR images. Two nodular lesions were observed in the left orbit, one of them measuring 2×1cm, located in the superior region, with involvement of the superior rectus and levator muscles; and the second, located at the level of the apex, with involvement of the external rectus, all highly suggestive of metastasis of the extrinsic ocular musculature.  Due to the patient's poor general condition, palliative radiotherapy was ruled out, and methylprednisolone boluses were started at a dose of 1g/day, with partial relief of pain. However, 48 hours after the second bolus of corticotherapy, the patient presented extreme abdominal and ocular pain, so palliative sedation was decided, and the patient died.   "
"A 42-year-old male patient came to the emergency department after suffering a contusion to his left eye. The patient had previously undergone phacoemulsification of the crystalline lens, with intraocular lens implantation; he subsequently underwent vitrectomy for retinal detachment. His post-surgery visual acuity was 2/10. On ophthalmological examination, visual acuity in the right eye was 10/10 and light perception and projection in the left eye. Biomicroscopically, the left eye showed moderate hyphema, significant iris dialysis with pupillary involvement, Descemet's folds and extreme hypotonia of the eyeball (later confirmed by applanation tonometry, which showed ocular tension close to zero). Fundus examination revealed a massive haemovitreous hemovitreous that made it impossible to visualise the retina. After ruling out an anterior penetrating injury, a diagnosis of suspected posterior scleral rupture was made and confirmed by orbital computerised axial tomography (CAT).  Given the condition of the globe, the patient was admitted and observation was indicated due to the high risk of massive expulsive suprachoroidal haemorrhage if surgery was performed1 . Antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment was prescribed, with close monitoring of the affected eye and the adelfus, as there was a possibility of sympathetic ophthalmia developing. Two weeks later, visual acuity improved from perceiving and projecting light to bulges, with a recovery of the structure of the eyeball; this was confirmed with a new orbital CT scan, showing a sealed posterior leakage point, compatible with reconstitution. After a few months of monitoring, there was progressive reabsorption of the haemovitreous tissue, with a significant choroidal scar rupture, which did not lead to an improvement in visual acuity due to macular and optic nerve involvement. In this case, at first we thought it was a massive ocular burst due to the initial CT image, but later, we thought that what really happened was a massive hyperpressure that compressed the eyeball giving the tomographic image and later, when the rupture was sealed, its constitution was recovered; the fact that the eyeball was vitrectomised contributed to all of this.   "
"A 79-year-old man diagnosed with VHL disease 20 years ago when, during an ophthalmological examination, capillary haemangiomas were found in both eyes (AO). He has seven children, three of whom and one granddaughter are affected by the disease. The only systemic involvement of the disease is renal cysts. She currently has a prosthesis in her right eye (OD) due to a former tractional retinal detachment (RD), and in her left eye (OI) she has a visual acuity (VA) of 0.3 with nasal photocoagulated haemangiomas and another larger one below, together with an epiretinal membrane in the posterior pole that alters the normal macular anatomy, compatible with the upper hyperreflective line shown in the optical coherence tomography (OCT). The membrane appeared after a vitrectomy performed 2 years ago after the patient presented with a grade III vitreous haemorrhage and an inferior tractional RD. After vitrectomy, the vitreous haemorrhage persisted and was treated with an intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF (bevacizumab), which resolved the haemorrhage.   "
"A 38-year-old man, allergic to penicillin, drinker of 80 grams of alcohol/day and obese, came to the Emergency Department of our Hospital presenting with oedema of the lower limbs, abdominal distension and fever of two days' evolution. He also reported severe asthenia for several weeks accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea for the last 7 days. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 37.5ºC, abdominal ascites and oedema in both lower limbs, mainly on the right, associated with erythema, petechiae and ecchymosis. No other pathological findings were observed on examination. The following results were obtained in the admission analysis: haemoglobin 8.3 g/dl; haematocrit: 23.3%; leukocytes 20,420 per µl (neutrophils 91.5%); platelets 119,000 per µl; D-dimers D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3, D3. 000 per µl; Dimeros D 14.080 ng/dl; Urea: 178 mg/dl; Creatinine 9 mg/dl; Na 124 mEq/l; K 3,9 mEq/l; Total proteins 5,6 gr/dl, LDH 559 UI/l; CPK 239 UI/l; GPT 35 UI/l; GOT 77 UI/l. Chest X-ray was normal and abdominal ultrasound and CT scan showed massive ascites, evidence of chronic liver disease and splenomegaly. With the clinical judgement of acute renal failure, in the context of a chronic hepatopathy of enolic origin and cellulitis in the lower extremity, he was admitted to the Nephrology Department. Treatment was started with diuretics (Furosemide) and empirical antibiotic therapy with Ciprofloxacin (1g/24 hours) after blood cultures were taken. Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient presented fever (38.4ºC) and worsening of the lesions on the right lower limb (MID), with increased pain, extension of the cellulitis and presence of blisters. Laboratory tests showed worsening renal function with plasma creatinine values of 10.60 mg/dl and urea 181 mg/dl, increased leukocytosis (35,340 per µl, neutrophils 96.8%) and coagulation alterations (prothrombin time of 28.8 seconds and activated partial thromboplastin time of 61.4 seconds). The blood culture performed on admission isolated Streptococcus Pyogenes, so intravenous antibiotherapy with Clindamycin and Gentamycin was started and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to haemodynamic instability and rapid progression of the lesions on the lower limb visible in a few hours, with skin anaesthesia, large blisters up to the middle third of the thigh and scrotal involvement. He required invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive amines and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration and urgent surgery was indicated in which scrotal debridement, debridement of the fascia up to the root of the thigh and open supracondylar amputation were performed.  He had an unfavourable evolution with multiorgan failure (acute renal failure, coagulopathy and acute respiratory distress syndrome) and did not respond to haemodynamic support measures or antibiotic therapy and finally died 24 hours after surgery.  "
"A 26-year-old woman, with no family history of breast cancer and a personal history of resection of fibroadenoma in the right breast 4 months before coming to our department. With this sole history, bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy was proposed to her as ""preventive treatment"" for possible cancer. The patient had not been sufficiently informed about the repercussions of this procedure. She did not undergo complementary ultrasound or mammography studies, nor BRCA 1 or 2 genetic studies. Two months after removal of the fibroadenoma, a bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy was performed in a private hospital by a medical oncologist in collaboration with a plastic surgeon. During the same operation, 400 cc round, textured, subcutaneous, saline breast implants were placed in the subcutaneous plane. When the stitches were removed, she presented wound dehiscence in both breasts, several secondary closures were performed without result, and she also suffered from erythema, increased temperature in both breasts and whitish material leaking from the wounds. In this situation she came to our department; 2 months had passed since the mastectomy. The patient reported that she had not requested such ""large"" implants, as her breast volume after the operation was almost one cup larger than previously.  Oral antibiotic treatment was given for 48 hours and on the third day, surgical lavage and removal of the implants with regularisation of the wound edges, suturing and placement of closed-circuit drains that were maintained for 3 days. Three months later, round, textured, 300 cc breast expanders with integrated valve were placed in the retromuscular plane. A final expansion of 320 cc was achieved and maintained for 18 months; although replacement of the expanders with prostheses was planned after 6 months, the patient refused further surgery. During this time, she began to experience stabbing pain in both breasts, so she finally agreed to the removal of the expanders and the placement of 295 cc silicone gel implants, round and textured, through a periareolar approach; at this time, the lower mammary poles were also freed, the size of the nipple-areola complex was reduced and bilateral radial capsulotomy was performed.  Postoperatively, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment was administered; one month after surgery, manual massage and ultrasound application was started and continued during the 2nd and 3rd month, followed by Endermology during the 4th month. As the patient reported persistent stabbing pain, Colchicine treatment was added for 5 months at a dose of 1 mg/day, which was reduced to 0.5 mg/day due to intestinal intolerance. The following 4 months, she was treated with Thalidomide at a dose of 50 mg/day. Eighteen months after implant placement, the patient continued to report painful discomfort, however, clinically the breasts were soft and the ultrasound study showed no data suggestive of prosthetic rupture or the presence of capsular contracture.  After 3 years, the patient presented frank capsular contracture and significant pain, but did not accept further surgical treatment due to a change of residence to the interior of the country. One year later, she returned requesting surgical treatment, at which time we proceeded to remove the implants and perform breast reconstruction with bilateral pedicled TRAM. Microsurgical treatment had been proposed to reduce the morbidity of the abdominal wall by preserving more of the rectus abdominis muscle, but the patient refused. No implants were used in the reconstruction and it was necessary to place a Marlex® mesh to cover the defect in the anterior abdominal wall once the two pedicled flaps had been raised.  We present images of the postoperative result 2.5 years after reconstruction, 8 years after the initial mastectomy.   "
"A 37-year-old single man, a farm worker, who was sent to our department from another hospital because it did not have the necessary experience to treat the type of lesion he was suffering from; at that time he presented a penoscrotal lesion for which he had been urgently admitted 15 days earlier to the Urology Department of his hospital of origin with a diagnosis of suspected infected sarcoma or lymphogranuloma venereum. He had not previously been seen or treated in any other medical centre. During the 10 days he was admitted to the urology department, he was initially treated with Metronidazole and Ceftazidime, and once the antibiogram had been performed, with Amikacin, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole and Cefotaxime. The biopsy diagnosis was Buscke-Lowenstein warty carcinoma. On admission, he presented with an exophytic tumour lesion on the penis measuring about 15 cm in diameter. The patient reported that it had started 6 months earlier as a small ulceration in the balanopreputial sulcus that progressively grew in the shape of a cauliflower and eventually infiltrated the surrounding tissues. In the penis, it affected the skin, dartos, Buck's fascia and albuginea, invaded the interior of the corpora cavernosa, destroyed the urethra and its spongiosa but respected the glans, and also infiltrated the pubic tissues, the scrotum and its contents. The boundaries between the affected tissues and healthy tissues were not well defined; in the affected tissues there was a deformed, soft, fungal, ulcerated, purplish mass, foul-smelling and bleeding in some areas; the peripheral tissues were oedematous and there were palpable bilateral iliac and inguinal adenopathies. The patient urinated through an inconspicuous fistulous orifice located between the mass and the remains of the destroyed urethra. Clinical tests were normal; serological tests for brucellosis, lupus and HIV were negative; bacteriological culture was positive for bacteroides caccae, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. Pathological examination of the biopsy indicated giant Buschke-Lowenstein condyloma acuminatum. Craniocaudal axial sections from the upper edge of the symphysis pubis to the root of the penis were performed using computerised axial tomography (CAT). The images showed bilateral lymphadenopathies in the internal and external iliac and inguinal chains; some of these lymphadenopathies exceeded one centimetre in diameter. The solid mass infiltrated the penis and scrotum and also appeared to infiltrate the fascia of the left adductor muscle, but no infiltration of the fat of the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the inner wall of the thighs or the fat of the perineum was observed, nor were there any bony lesions in the ischio-ileo-pubic branches suggestive of metastatic infiltration.  Given the characteristics of the tumour, the involvement of the lymph node chains and the possibility of malignancy, it was decided to perform radical surgical treatment, which was carried out 3 days after admission to Plastic Surgery. Under general anaesthesia, with the patient in the supine position and the lower limbs apart, we made a perilesional incision through the pubis, inguinal folds and perineum, excising the tumour lesion en bloc; we then performed a lymphadenectomy of the affected chains, thus completing the emasculinisation of the patient. The incisions of the lymphadenectomies were closed in planes and the perineum-inguino-pubic area was covered with a skin graft taken from the left thigh.   Intraoperative study of an irregular biopsy specimen measuring 3 x 2 cm revealed a nodular formation with the appearance of a lymph node, suspicious for carcinoma metastasis due to the existence of non-conclusive atypical cells. The anatomopathological study of the excised piece described: an irregular piece of warty appearance, which on one side shows the penile glans penis, measuring 18 x 15 x 12 cm of larger dimensions. The tumour occupies most of the piece, encompasses the penis circumferentially and affects the skin of the pubis, scrotum and perineum. When cut, the tumour is friable, with vegetative growth on the surface and papillomatous growth in depth, which also deeply affects the glans and perineal tissues; the testicles are engulfed by fibrosis and the tumour mass, although not infiltrated. The lymph nodes of the lymphatic chains sent for analysis are reactive, but free of tumour metastases. After surgery, the patient was admitted to the resuscitation unit for 2 hours and then to the hospital ward for 25 days. A second operation was necessary due to partial necrosis of a small area of the wound of the left lymphadenectomy incision and the loss of approximately 25% of the skin graft used for the perineo-inguino-pubic closure. During hospital admission, the usual postoperative medical treatment was administered and no blood transfusion was necessary. The patient remained catheterised since the operation and was discharged from hospital with the catheter, which he kept for a further month at home. As a result of the operation, a small stump was left with a hole in the perineal region, where the urethra ends and through which urination takes place. Despite having been explained to the patient the different types of surgical procedures available for penile reconstruction (5), with their advantages and disadvantages, he has always refused to undergo reconstructive surgery.    As a consequence of emasculinisation, he developed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which is why he has been treated with testosterone since the operation (12 years to the present). On the other hand, as it is a benign tumour, no postoperative medical treatment of any kind has been carried out, nor radio or chemotherapy as they are not indicated.    "
"A 9-year-old male presented after a traffic accident with a complex post-traumatic defect in the left foot and ankle including a 7 x 10 cm loss of substance with exposure of the tibial malleolus, talus and subtalar joint, section of the posterior tibial tendon and long flexor tendon of the toes and avulsion of the tibial nerve and posterior tibial artery with a defect of 5 cm. The foot remains vascularised through the anterior tibial artery.  After the relevant debridement of devitalised tissue, reconstruction of the defect was considered 5 days after the trauma, by repairing the affected tendons, reconstructing the tibial nerve with sural nerve grafts and covering the defect with an ALM perforator flap. Preoperatively a 7 x 10 cm flap is designed on the left thigh based on a localised perforator with Doppler. After a standard subfascial dissection of the flap following the description made by Wei et al. (4), we located a perforator with a very long intramuscular course and small diameter; it was then decided to explore proximally the transverse branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery (LFA) in order to look for a better perforator. A larger caliber perforator is located at that level and the flap is redesigned to become a TFL perforator flap, drawing a skin island more proximally with centre at the new perforator; the lateral femorocutaneous nerve of the thigh is included in the flap to provide sensation. After repair of the tibial nerve with 3 sural nerve grafts of 5cm each, transfer and fixation of the flap is performed. Anastomoses are made termino-terminally to the posterior tibial artery and to two veins, a posterior tibial comitant vein and the great saphenous vein. The lateral femorocutaneous nerve of the flap is connected termino-laterally to the proximal end of the tibial nerve. Finally, a direct closure of the donor site is performed. The total operative time was 7 hours and 30 minutes. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged from hospital 18 days after surgery.  The physiotherapy programme started from the first postoperative week, with partial foot support (with the aid of crutches and a protective splint) one month after surgery and full foot support for ambulation at 6 weeks. At 4 months after surgery the foot contour was adequate, allowing the patient to wear normal footwear, with a range of ankle mobility of 45º of plantar flexion and 15º of dorsal flexion and a protective sensitivity (detected with monofilament test) of the plantar and flap.

"An 18-year-old female patient who had undergone surgery for cloacal exstrophy (reconstruction of the intestinal and urinary tracts) in another care centre, and who came to our department presenting with absence of the anterior abdominal wall, unstable skin, pubic eventration, numerous scar sequelae and an incontinent urinary reservoir.  Wall reconstruction, eventroplasty and urinary ostoma plasty are scheduled, working as a team with the Surgery and Paediatric Urology Service. 1st surgical stage: Consisted of the placement of 2 rectangular expanders of 1000cc. (with expansion capacity up to 1500cc) and 15.2 cm. long x 7.3 cm. wide with remote valve (Silimed®) below the abdominal cellulo-fatty tissue and above the aponeurosis of the greater oblique muscle in subcostal and lateral position. Expansion was performed at a rate of between 50 and 100 cc of physiological solution at intervals of 1 week to 20 days, depending on the patient's tolerance, until reaching 1300 cc.  2nd Surgical time: Once the expansion is complete, the urinary wall and ostoma surgery is scheduled. The paediatric plastic surgery team removed the expanders and the urological surgeon performed the urinary ostoma plasty. Both surgical teams then proceeded to reconstruct the upper and middle thirds of the wall using the remaining tissues of the rectus abdominis sheath, rectus abdominis muscle and remaining scar tissue. In the lower third and pubis, due to the absence of tissue, it was decided to use a 15 x 10 cm polypropylene (Prolene®) prosthetic mesh over the lax scar tissue covering the eventration, anchoring it to the pubic bones and the greater oblique muscle on both sides. Reconstruction of the skin and cellulo-fatty tissues is achieved by advancing the expanded lateral tissues.  The patient evolved favourably without complications and vaginal reconstructive surgery was performed one year later.  Despite the pubic diastasis of almost 17cm, the patient has no gait disturbance and has not undergone any treatment by her own decision.  "
"A 6-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy who had undergone surgery on several occasions in different institutions; at the time of consultation she presented with multiple fistulas and scars on the abdominal wall with a significant deficit of antero-superior abdominal tissue. Due to the previous failure in the creation of a bladder reservoir, reconstruction is programmed, operating as a team with the Paediatric Urology Service.  1st surgical stage: Consisted in the placement of 2 rectangular expanders of 1000cc. and 15,2cm. long x 7, 3cm wide with remote valve (Silimed®) below the abdominal cellulo-fatty tissue and above the aponeurosis of the greater oblique muscle in subcostal and lateral position. Between 50 to 100cc of saline were infiltrated at intervals of 1 week to 20 days, according to the patient's tolerance, until a volume of 1150cc was reached.  2nd Surgical time: Once the expansion was completed, the expanders were removed and the ileocecal urinary reservoir was reconstructed, after which the abdominal defect was reconstructed by lifting and cross-linking two major oblique flaps, with a rotation axis in the lower ribs, which were covered with the expanded fascio-cutaneous tissues.  The patient evolved favourably without complications. .   "
"18-year-old patient who 5 months earlier had been the victim of a severe 13,800 volt electrical burn to the face while trying to save a co-worker. He presented an extensive injury with loss of both lips and nose. Extensive scarring of the perioral and adjacent areas made it impossible to use any type of local flap for reconstruction of the area. In the nasal region there was loss of skin substance and nasal lining, as well as part of the cartilaginous covering of the dorsum, tip, tail and nasal wings. He had undergone surgical reconstruction with a frontal flap 4 months earlier in another department, but this had progressed to necrosis.  Reconstruction was scheduled using a bipedicled flap from the anterior cervical region, described by Tsur (3), for lip reconstruction and a right supratrochlear flap for reconstruction of the nasal lining and a left supratrochlear flap for nasal coverage. There was a partial loss of the left supratrochlear coverage flap and a small partial loss of the right supratrochlear flap for the nasal lining, which were observed at 3 days postoperatively. On the fifteenth day, one of the cervical flap pedicles was released and on the 30th day, the other was released after complete integration of the flap to the upper lip. Thereafter, several flaps were performed under local anaesthesia, every 2 months, for the reconstruction of the lower lip, the tailbone and the nasal tip, and thinning by defatting of the main flaps was also performed. A total of 7 complementary procedures were performed. Persistent residual oedema of the cervical flap, keloids and hypertrophic scars appeared in the donor areas, which were treated with intralesional corticosteroids. The final reconstruction, 2 years after the Tsur flap was made, made it possible to create an emotionally expressive structure although with limited functionality; touch-ups and refinements improved the final result, achieving a satisfactory aesthetic appearance and food continence, which sufficiently pleased the patient. At present, 4 years after the initial surgery, no further surgical treatments have been scheduled.   "
"A 70-year-old woman underwent surgery by the Cardiac Surgery Department for a complex valve problem. She presented with multiple post-surgical complications that aggravated her general condition due to pump failure. After two weeks of hospitalisation, she began to develop septic symptoms originating in the mediastinum. The surgical wound was opened, with exposure of the heart, and daily dressings with physiological saline solution. Two weeks after the first operation, the cardiac surgery team performed an omentum flap to repair the defect, without success. Two months after admission, the patient was still in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with assisted ventilatory support, drug-induced coma and had developed generalised polyneuropathy; extensive exposure of the heart, with opening of the pleura in both hemithoraxes and herniation of a left pulmonary lobe with respiratory movements. It was decided to perform reconstruction using a latissimus dorsi flap and alloplastic material (Gore-tex®) to repair the central defect and pulmonary herniation. Part of the previously performed omentum flap was used to cover the defect. The patient evolved favourably, her neurological condition improved gradually and she was transferred to the ward 18 days later, to be discharged home one month after the operation. The patient died 6 months later from pneumonia affecting the right lung.   "
"A 12-year-old woman reported having suffered a left facial abscess of dental origin. The predominant clinical manifestations at the time of our assessment were inability to open her mouth. The most significant finding in the CT scan and in the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMR) was the absence of the left parotid gland and the mandibular deformity with fusion of its posterior wall to the maxilla and left pterygoid process, with the consequent anterior displacement of the mandibular condyles due to severe dysplasia of the temporomandibular joint. Given the clinical situation described, tracheotomy was required to proceed with the extrarticular release of the maxillomandibular ankylosis, extraction of the affected teeth and coverage with a standard mucosal flap. In the immediate postoperative period the buccal opening was fixed by 2 cm using a retromolar wedge.  At the present time the patient maintains a 2.4 cm buccomandibular opening, which allows solid oral feeding. Confirmation of this entity was made by anatomopathological study which reported changes compatible with chronic osteomyelitis.  "
"A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic renal failure on haemodialysis since 2005. In April 2010 she underwent a renal transplant from a cadaver donor, following immunosuppressive treatment. On the fourth postoperative day, the patient presented with fever, worsening general condition and erythematous lesions on the right flank, which rapidly evolved with the appearance of phlyctenas and skin necrosis. The Nephrology Department performed a biopsy and culture of the lesions and requested the collaboration of our department.  Given the clinical suspicion of necrotising fasciitis, it was decided to start intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy and perform immediate surgical debridement up to the muscular plane, without including it, covering an area of approximately 25 X 25 cm in the right flank and ribcage. We adjusted the immunosuppressive treatment, maintaining only Prograf (Tacrolimus) and suspending Mycophenolate and Dacortin, and started broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic treatment with Ciprofloxacin (400 mg/12 hours), Teicoplanin (400 mg/12 hours), Clindamycin (600 mg/6 hours) and Tobramycin (50 mg/12 hours). Samples obtained for culture were positive for Escherichia coli. After debridement, treatment was started with negative pressure therapy with VAC® system for 13 days at 125 mmHg and cures every 48 hours.  Once the problem area was clean, granulated and free of infection (13 days after debridement), it was covered with autologous partial-thickness skin grafts again associated with VAC® therapy with Granofoam dressing at 125 mmHg for 10 days, with the first dressing on the fourth day and then every 48 hours. In the first treatment after grafting, we found that the graft was properly attached and with no signs of acute complications such as haematoma or infection, which led us to withdraw antibiotic treatment and restart the suspended immunosuppressant treatment, as recommended by the Nephrology Department.  After 24 days of hospitalisation, the patient was discharged by our department and continued under a regime of outpatient occlusive dressings using antibiotic tulgrase and gauze impregnated with povidone iodine. The first outpatient plastic surgery appointment was made 2 weeks after hospital discharge (18 days post-grafting), at which time the problem area was found to be healed. At 6 months, we performed an evolutionary control.  The therapeutic combination of IV antibiotics, the suppression of 2 of the 3 immunosuppressants that the patient was taking due to her kidney transplant, surgical debridement and VAC® therapy accelerated the wound cleaning and contraction process, as well as helping the autologous partial skin grafts to take hold quickly and completely, and the patient had acceptable skin coverage. The patient was offered the possibility of implanting 2 skin expanders and performing a more aesthetic reconstruction later, but the patient declined the offer as she was satisfied with the current result.   "
"A 54-year-old man with the following personal history: ex-alcoholic, ex-smoker, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) classified as moderate-severe mixed respiratory disability, liver disease, polyarthrosis, polymyalgia rheumatica and Barret's oesophagus. Due to chronic corticosteroid treatment, in May 2010 he suffered an osteoporotic vertebral crushing for which he underwent surgery consisting of vertebral fusion D2-D7 and vertebroplasty D4-D5. One month later, he was transferred to our hospital with a diagnosis of D4 ASIA C transverse spinal cord injury syndrome for evaluation and rehabilitation treatment; the latter was impossible from the outset due to the instability of the vertebral injury. In addition, it was necessary to perform daily local dressings and every 2-3 days regular dressings in the operating theatre due to the presence of an open, infected and sphacelated wound in the upper dorsal vertebral region. In this way, an attempt was made to maintain the osteosynthesis material and prevent the clinical evolution of his spinal injury. Finally, given the impossibility of reducing the bacterial load of the wound and proceeding to close it, we decided to remove all the osteosynthesis material in October. We prescribed cures with local antiseptics until a suitable bed was achieved in order to perform, in January 2011, a trapezius flap with a skin paddle to cover the existing defect. In the immediate postoperative period following this operation, untimely postural manoeuvres were performed, which iatrogenically caused venous congestion of the described flap. One month later, we proceeded to debride the affected tissues and placed 2 portable VAC® systems for one month: one to manage the exudate generated in the area of the muscle detachment and the other in the cranial and caudal part of the skin flap. We chose the black foam dressing modality (granufoam: polyurethane 400-600 micrometre pore size) for the dressing because it was a relatively small residual wound (4 x 5 cm), with few signs of infection, and because of the need to improve local blood flow to limit tissue loss and thus promote the generation of granulation tissue. Therapy was instituted continuously at -125mmHg for the first 48 hours and then lowered to -75mmHg until the end of treatment.  In March 2011 we covered the 3 previously described areas with autografts, already granulated, and fixed them with a state-of-the-art portable VAC® system (VIA®) for a further week at -75 mmHg, and the patient was then transferred to the Rehabilitation Service to continue with his gait recovery programme.   "
"Patient diagnosed at 38 years of age with multifocal infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast. She underwent surgery at our institution, a second level hospital, with modified left radical mastectomy on reduction pattern, homolateral axillary lymphadenectomy and immediate reconstruction with latissimus dorsi flap and 475cc textured anatomical prosthesis (model 20636 Polytech®, Polytech Healthand Aesthetics, Dieburg, Germany) in retromuscular position in a pocket formed by the junction of the pectoralis muscle with the latissimus dorsi. A right reduction mammoplasty designed in the same pattern with inferior pedicle for the nipple-areola complex was also performed for symmetry.  As postoperative adjuvant treatment she underwent chemotherapy, as planned at the time of diagnosis of the carcinoma, and radiotherapy as 3 metastatic axillary lymph nodes were found during surgery. The patient completed radiotherapy 8 months after surgery and 2 months later, the radiation received led to severe radiodermatitis and a spontaneous seroma which, after several attempts at drainage, led to explantation of the prosthesis one year after the initial surgery. The genetic counselling diagnosis recommended prophylactic right mastectomy as it was considered a high risk because the biopsy of the reduction specimen showed ductal hyperplasia with atypia.  Due to the impossibility of using the latissimus dorsi flap and the sequelae of radiotherapy, after assessing the reconstructive possibilities, we referred the patient to a tertiary hospital as our second level institution is not qualified for vascular microsurgery techniques. The indication was to perform breast reconstruction with a bilateral DIEP microsurgical flap. One year after the explantation, the indicated prophylactic mastectomy of the right breast and microsurgical reconstruction with bilateral DIEP flap was performed. The evolution, after a postoperative pulmonary infection that required admission to the Intensive Care Unit, was unfavourable, and total necrosis of both DIEP flaps occurred. After a year had passed and the scars had stabilised, we assessed whether there was really any possibility of reconstruction given the patient's age and the severity of the sequelae (radiodermatitis and skin adhesions to the ribcage). We decided to try to improve the skin cover with an autotransplant of fat in order to be able to support tissue expanders in the future and achieve moderate-sized breasts.  Two sessions of autologous fat grafting were performed at an interval of 6 months and on an outpatient basis. In the first session, fat was obtained from the abdomen and after processing with centrifugation, 240cc of autologous fat was injected in the right thoracic region and 200cc in the left thoracic region. In the second session, fat was obtained from the flanks and crotch and 160cc. was transferred to the left breast. We achieved clinical improvement in terms of tissue thickness, release of soft tissue adhesions of the left thoracic radiodermatitis and, at the same time, we achieved a discreet increase in volume.  At 6 months we decided to place tissue expanders. We chose anatomically shaped tissue expanders (Mentor®, Johnson & Johnson, New Jersey, USA), 350cc. In the right hemithorax, the expander was implanted in a retropectoral plane without any technical difficulties. We had the additional problem of the precariousness of the tissues and the previous radiodermatitis in the left hemithorax. To prevent extrusion, we proceeded with the surgery by suturing with Vycril® 3/0 a sheet of Strattice® dermal matrix 8 x 16cm from a fibrous remnant found at the site of the inferior border of the pectoralis major to the submammary sulcus. The role of the matrix was to protect the lower pole of the expander which was located in a subpectoral plane in the upper part and covered by the Strattice® sheet in the lower half. The postoperative period was uneventful. Filling sessions of the expanders occurred normally from 2 weeks postoperatively. The amount of filling per session ranged from 20 to 60cc per expander to a total volume of 360cc spread over 7 sessions and with an average interval of 3 weeks. The great elasticity and the low resistance to expansion of the left breast, contrary to what was expected due to the previous radiotherapy, should be highlighted, so that after 4 months the process had been satisfactorily completed.  At 5 months we proceeded to replace the expanders with definitive 380cc, anatomical, textured prostheses (Polytech® model 20737). We observed a total integration of the dermal matrix which contributed to the thickening of the soft tissue. Three months later, given the favourable evolution of the patient, with no evidence of capsular contracture, we reconstructed the nipples with local fleur de Lys flaps. The flap of the breast that had previously undergone radiotherapy suffered partial necrosis. At the time of writing this article, we are performing micropigmentation technique for the areola. Eight months after the last intervention the patient is satisfied with the result and has been able to fully reincorporate into her social and working life.   "
"A 46-year-old woman underwent radical left mastectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy in October 2005 due to hormone receptor-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma in the upper outer quadrant and lymph node metastasis in 1 of 13 isolated nodes. In the same surgical procedure, immediate reconstruction was performed by placing an expander prosthesis (anatomical Becker) with a 300 cc. volume textured silicone gel layer, starting expansion 2 weeks after surgery and reaching the maximum expansion volume 1 month later. As a complementary treatment, chemotherapy was established according to a sequential scheme of adriamycin-cyclophosphamide and taxane, receiving a total of 24 sessions during the period from November 2005 to May 2007, followed by trastuzumab. Complementary hormonal treatment with letrozole was maintained for a period of approximately 3 years. The second stage of reconstruction was performed in July 2006, by replacing the expander prosthesis with a 320 cc textured silicone gel breast implant in the same subpectoral location. In the follow-up clinical controls, a depression was observed at the medial edge of the mastectomy scar, in the form of a hatchet, which displeased both the patient and the surgical team, so it was decided to remodel it in March 2007 by means of a fat graft of adipose tissue obtained from the abdominal area and processed using the Coleman technique, after infiltration of the scar with 3 cc of local anaesthetic (lidocaine). The scar was infiltrated with 3 cc. of local anaesthetic (lidocaine 1% with adrenaline); it was performed without incident and a total of 5 cc. of fatty tissue was infiltrated in the area of the defect. The patient continued to be monitored by the Gynaeco-Oncology Department, and follow-up imaging tests were carried out in accordance with our hospital's guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumours. Specifically, 4 annual mammograms and 2 breast ultrasound scans were performed between May 2006 and April 2009, with no evidence of alterations suggesting damage to the integrity of the prosthesis. In March 2010 a new breast ultrasound was performed in which a previously unreported cystic ovoid image was visualised on the anterior surface of the interior of the breast prosthesis, so the radiologist decided to perform an MRI. This procedure was carried out one month later and a nodular image was observed in the prosthesis, located in the internal interquadrant area, about 2.5cm in diameter, which appeared as an image of liquid content, with no inflammatory signs or signs of prosthetic rupture. In different sections it appeared as if an elongated hook-shaped structure was introduced into the prosthesis, similar to the way a finger is introduced into a half-inflated balloon. The patient did not report any symptoms.  In view of these images, we decided to perform a surgical exploration, taking into account the possibility of having to remove the breast prosthesis. At first it was thought that the fatty infiltrate might have entered the prosthetic capsule and pushed the prosthesis, without breaking it, creating a deep concavity inside it, like a tunnel. During the operation, it was found that the prosthesis appeared to be intact and that there was no tissue inside the capsule that could alter the shape of the implant. There were no alterations in the area of the capsule that was in contact with the site of fat infiltration, but we nevertheless decided to take a biopsy of the area of injected fatty tissue; this biopsy corresponded in the histological study with fibrous tissue with no signs of malignancy. When we removed the prosthesis for examination, we were struck by the fact that there were several opaque spots scattered in different places inside it, with no linear distribution, which might lead us to believe that these were needle punctures. However, at a point close to the largest of these, after applying strong compression to the prosthesis, we saw that the cohesive silicone of the implant was slightly herniated. We then decided, once the implant had been removed, to open it and send samples of the material inside. The removed implant was replaced with another of the same characteristics.  The anatomopathological study reported the sample analysed from inside the prosthesis as haematic material.   "
"Three-year-old boy, with no family history of congenital deformities or pathology detected during pregnancy. Physical examination revealed hypoplasia of the right forearm with absence of the third, fourth and fifth digital rays and ulnar deviation of the hand by 60 degrees. Mobility of the thumb and index finger was adequate with good prehensile strength. Sensitivity was considered normal in the two-point discrimination test. Radiologically there was ulnar and radial hypoplasia at the expense of the distal third, with radiohumeral synostosis, absence of early carpal bones and absence of the third, fourth and fifth rays. The total length of the radius was 5.8 cm and 3.0 cm for the ulna, while in the healthy forearm it was 12.0 cm for the radius and 12.4 cm for the ulna, which comparatively corresponded to a deficiency of 48.3% for the radius and 24.1% for the ulna. The humerus on the affected side had a length of 15.5 cm and on the healthy side 17 cm. A diagnosis of right upper limb longitudinal formation failure, postaxial, Bayne's grade IV, with moderate humeral longitudinal shortening was established.  We decided to perform bone elongation of the forearm bones by placing a uniplanar transfixion distractor designed by JMY México® according to the characteristics proposed by Matev (13). Although the lengths of the radius and ulna were different, the distraction of both bones was performed simultaneously. In the first surgical stage, two parallel pins were placed proximal and two distal to the site chosen in the diaphysis of both bones for osteotomy, leaving only the posterior cortex and with a margin between the proximal and distal pins of 3 cm. An incomplete circular osteotomy covering 300 degrees of the circumference was performed and the rest of the cortex was left intact. The postoperative course was uneventful. On the fourth postoperative day we started the distraction phase at a rate of 2 mm per day for the first 15 days and then at 1 mm per day for 45 days until a total elongation of 7.5 cm was achieved in 60 days. The total length achieved for the radius was 13.3 cm and for the ulna 10.5 cm. Four weeks after completion of distraction we observed adequate longitudinal bone formation radiologically. However, we left the distractor in place until 8 weeks after stopping distraction, at which time we found that there was excellent bone structure in the gap.  The second surgical time was performed at this time to remove the distractor and to perform centralisation of the hand over the distal radial epiphysis. To facilitate this procedure it was necessary to perform a diaphyseal resection of the radius. The new bony fixation was performed with Kischner pins. No osteotomy of the ulna was necessary because its elongation was in the direction of the vector traction and no deviation was observed.  The postoperative evolution was satisfactory, with discrete oedema of the hand that subsided after a short time; the patient recovered the mobility of the fingers and did not suffer any alteration of sensibility. Six months after completion of the forearm procedure, we placed the distractor in the humerus diaphysis with the same technical procedure as previously described, although it is important to note the anatomical risk points of the nerves and vessels in order to perform the technique meticulously and avoid injury to these structures. In the semicircular corticotomy, we preserved the posterior portion of the periosteum to save the radial nerve; the pins were placed in parallel, two proximal and two distal, with a 3 cm margin between them to perform the corticotomy. Four days later, we started the elongation process at a rate of 1 mm per day, until a gain of 6 cm was achieved. We decided to overcorrect the bone to balance it with the growth of the contralateral arm. At the end of the procedure, we left the distractor in place for 8 weeks, during which time we verified by radiology the adequate bony healing of the gap created for humeral longitudinal growth.  Finally, 8 weeks after completion of the humeral distraction, the time chosen to remove the distractor, we performed the elbow arthrodesis, leaving the elbow joint in a functional position.   "
"A 56-year-old woman, hypertensive, with a history of poliomyelitis at one year of age and sequelae in the left lower limb that required multiple interventions to enable her to walk properly, as well as lumbar spine surgery at 42 years of age. Diagnosed with spinal pathology of D11-D12 and L3-L4, she underwent L1-L5 pósterolateral arthrodesis plus lamina graft and bone substitute, presenting poor evolution, with infection of the surgical wound and necrosis of the paravertebral musculature that required 3 new interventions to debride the non-viable tissue. After the third operation, she was fitted with a vacuum therapy system and was referred to our department, a reference centre for reconstructive surgery. The time between the first spinal surgery and the time of referral to our department was approximately 18 days. The patient was transferred on a stretcher as she was unable to ambulate and had significant atrophy in both lower limbs, as well as a defect in the dorso-lumbar area measuring approximately 20 x 5 cm in diameter, with exposure of the spinal column and osteosynthesis material. There were no signs of infection.  We performed a study of the extent of the defect by means of computerised axial tomography (CT), which reported an instrumented arthrodesis from L1-S1 with resection of posterior elements and posterior soft tissue augmentation in the surgical site, with traces of air and soft tissue mass suggesting post-surgical changes, with no evidence of abscesses. We also performed dorsal-lumbar CT angiography to determine the viability of the paravertebral muscle-cutaneous perforators.  We maintained the vacuum therapy system in the surgical wound for 20 days, while imaging and pre-anaesthetic studies were completed, to assist in cleansing the lesion. Planning of the surgical procedure included debridement of the scar tissue, coverage of the deep bony structures with well-vascularised tissue and closure of the skin defect without tension. Under general anaesthesia, with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, we performed excisional debridement of the inverted skin edges and fibrous scar tissue in the lumbar region. We designed and raised a reverse latissimus dorsi muscle flap based on the secondary pedicles, transposed it to the lumbar defect by tunnelling and fixed it to the healthy perilesional muscle tissue. We placed 4 spiral drains, 2 in the donor area and 2 in the recipient area, one in the submuscular plane and the other in the subcutaneous plane. The donor site was closed directly, in planes, without tension. The skin of the recipient site was closed after Friedrich of the edges, without tension and without compressing the muscle flap.  Five days postoperatively, we observed an increase in the right paravertebral volume after abrupt mobilisation of the patient in bed. Ultrasonography revealed a right paravertebral intramuscular haematoma measuring 15 x 2 cm in size. Under general anaesthesia, we evacuated a coagulated haematoma and checked the viability of the muscle flap, re-closing the wound. After 18 days, the patient began to walk with the aid of a walker, recovering the functionality of the lower limbs and was discharged on postoperative day 22. During the 2-year follow-up after surgery, the patient showed normal deambulation and an excellent local evolution of the flap.   "
"This is a 7-year-old girl, with no relevant pathological or neonatal history, who presented for consultation with a clinical picture of 8 months' evolution consisting of a right upper gingival nodular lesion of approximately 3 x 3 cm in diameter, and who reported slow growth for 8 months, which accelerated in the 2 months prior to consultation. A computerised tomography (CT) scan was requested which showed a right maxillary tumour with infiltration towards the antrum and nasal cavity measuring 3 x 3 cm in diameter. In view of this diagnosis, the Paediatric Surgery Department indicated marginal resection of the maxillary tumour using a sublabial approach and the histopathological report of the resection specimen showed a 3 cm maxillary chondrosarcoma with grade II differentiation. The patient was subsequently sent for complementary treatment with adjuvant radiotherapy, which she did not attend. One year later she was readmitted to hospital with a recurrence of the tumour after 2 months of evolution. The tumour now showed accelerated growth, measuring 9 x 6 cm in diameter on CT scan and occupying the entire right maxilla and partially the left maxilla. Chemotherapy treatment was indicated at that time for tumour reduction and the patient received 9 cycles of Doxurrubicin 30 mg per m2 of body surface area; Vincristine 1.5 mg per m2; Mesna 300 mg per m2 and Cyclophosphamide 300 mg per m2, for 5 months, without achieving the desired effect. In view of this, the Plastic Surgery, Oncological Surgery and Head and Neck Surgery Departments were asked to assess the patient and decided to submit her to a new surgical intervention in which, after a tracheostomy, we performed a bilateral subtotal maxillectomy with palatectomy, including the tumour in its entirety and preserving the soft palate. The resection specimen was 10 x 8 cm, greyish, firm, with reddish mucosa, haemorrhagic and with areas of necrosis of 30%. The histopathological study performed with light microphotography and haematoxylin/eosin staining confirmed the diagnosis of grade II chondrosarcoma, cellular pleomorphism with 2 mitotic figures per field and with surgical edges free of tumour and without vascular permeation.  In the same surgical procedure we carried out partial and temporary maxillary reconstruction with titanium mini-plates and alloplastic prosthesis.  After 8 months of follow-up after radical surgery, the patient is in good general condition, with an adequate scarring process, with no evidence of local or distant tumour activity as evidenced by both clinical and CT scans.   "
"A 54-year-old woman, with no medical history of interest, was referred to the plastic surgery department for a condition of 2 months' duration that started with pain and paraesthesia in the right leg. In the last few weeks she had worsened, presenting with foot drop and difficulties in walking. The patient's symptoms were suggestive of right sciatic nerve neuropathy. Physical examination revealed an increase in size on the posterior aspect of the right thigh and palpation of a large, deep, soft and painful tumour. The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggested a neuropathy of the sciatic nerve, probably due to extrinsic compression by the tumour. The following complementary studies were performed to confirm the diagnosis: - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): a mass with maximum diameters of 14 x 9 x 5 cm (craniocaudal x transverse x anteroposterior) was visualised deep in the posterior compartment of the distal half of the right thigh, mostly with a signal similar to fatty tissue, although there were some septa and micronodular images with intermediate signal intensity in T1 and high in STIR and T2-SPIR. This mass subsequently displaced the sciatic nerve, findings which, although they could be related to a lipoma, also suggest the need to rule out a low-grade liposarcoma.  - Electromyography (EMG): compatible with compression of the sciatic nerve at the level of the distal third of the right thigh. Given the patient's symptoms and the finding of a tumour in the MRI, it was decided to carry out surgical treatment of the tumour. We performed surgery under spinal anaesthesia, resecting the tumour and releasing the sciatic nerve at the level of the tumour. The patient did not present any postoperative complications.  The anatomopathological study of the surgical specimen revealed macroscopically a large tumour of lipomatous appearance, yellow, rounded, well delimited, 12 x 10 x 4 cm in size and weighing 266.7 g, with no haemorrhagic or necrotic areas on section.  Microscopically it is mature adipose tissue, separated into lobules by fine fibrous tracts and numerous small vessels at the periphery. The adipose cells show no atypia or mitosis. The patient's evolution was satisfactory, with a gradual decrease in pain and paraesthesia and a gradual recovery of muscle strength to normal. After a postoperative follow-up of 15 months, the patient is asymptomatic, with no paresthesia, no pain, no gait disturbance and no evidence of recurrence.   "
"A 48-year-old male, a long-standing diabetic, poorly controlled, who presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with a 5-day history of pain, oedema and increased temperature in the left upper and lower eyelid, according to the patient, secondary to blunt trauma that initially caused a minor dermabrasion. On admission, he was assessed by Ophthalmology and diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis. Eight hours after admission, he developed a necrotic eschar in the involved tissue. On the first day of hospitalisation he underwent surgical cleaning and debridement of all the necrotic tissue. Material was sent for bacteriological culture, identifying Streptococcus Pyogenes. Based on this result, the patient was assessed by Infectious Diseases and treatment was started with Meropenem, Vancomycin, Clindamycin and Amphotericin.  On the second day of hospitalisation, he was assessed by the Wound Clinic of the Dermatology Department and treatment was started with negative pressure therapy at 125 mmHg continuously, with the aim of controlling exudate, promoting granulation and reducing dead space. This therapy was suspended 3 days later (on the fifth day of hospitalisation) due to progression of the erythema towards the contralateral palpebral portion. The patient continued in the care of Ophthalmology and Dermatology, being treated with physiological solution and isodine-based dressings and covered with alginate patches, a procedure which managed to control the infectious process.  Fifteen days after hospitalisation, he was assessed by Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, who observed skin loss of the entire upper eyelid, partial loss of the orbicularis oculi and levator muscle (the latter was disinserted), good granulation tissue and focal loss of conjunctiva.  One month after the initial assessment, the patient underwent surgery and the granulation tissue was debrided until partial closure of the eyelid was achieved, identifying an intact tarsal plate. We performed local flaps to close defects in the conjunctiva, lateral canthotomy, full-thickness graft in the medial canthus and right frontalis musculocutaneus flap, which we attached to the superoexternal remnant of the orbicularis oculi muscle of the eyelid.  Four weeks later, we performed the pedicle section and frontalis flap thinning, seeing that the patient presented palpebral movement dependent on frontalis myorrhaphy with the orbicularis oculi remnant.  The patient persisted with greater volume and eversion of the reconstructed eyelid, so 2 months later we thinned the flap again and corrected the lagophthalmos by lateral canthopexy, freeing the palpebral ligament and reinserting it into the orbital rim.  After 2 years of evolution, the eyeball was covered with complete closure and opening of the eyelid, with no visual repercussions. No new surgical treatment was required.   "
"A 20-year-old male was referred from a hospital outside the city of Managua (Nicaragua) after suffering trauma to the left arm from a moving vehicle, resulting in a transverse open fracture of the middle third of the humerus type III C according to Gustilo's classification, initially treated with an external fixator and vascular lesion of the brachial artery which could not be repaired. She arrived at our hospital 12 hours after the accident. Physical examination of the upper extremity revealed an absence of distal peripheral radial and ulnar pulses, a negative Allen test and a decrease in temperature. We performed a real-time Doppler study with a high-frequency linear B-mode probe that showed flow with attenuated waves in the proximal brachial artery, but not in the middle and distal portions, where there was an absence of colour Doppler, power Doppler and spectral signals, with no flow in the distal arteries (radial and ulnar). The patient was admitted to the operating theatre where we found a linear wound on the anterior surface of the arm and complete section of the biceps brachii in the middle 1/3, distal and proximal end of the brachial artery knotted with 2-0 silk, with a gap of 8 cm in length, exposed fracture of the middle third of the humerus displaced and forearm with tension, decreased temperature and stiffness. We kept the limb in warm ischaemia and decided to perform sequential reconstruction of the limb in 2 stages. First reconstruction time: vascular repair In collaboration with the Vascular Surgery Department, we proceeded to take a 20 cm long graft from the greater saphenous vein of the left lower limb and transposed 10 cm of graft to the vasobrachial arcade, with end-to-end anastomosis by means of loose stitches with 8-0 nylon under 4.3X magnification. The fracture line is thus exposed. We therefore achieved revascularisation of the limb 16 hours after the accident. We also performed an anterior forearm fasciotomy to treat the compartment syndrome associated with the trauma. Second reconstruction time: internal fixation and coverage After demonstrating adequate perfusion of the tissues in the area of the injury and distal to it, and 48 hours after vascular repair, we performed internal fixation of the humerus fracture with an endomedullary nail 8 mm in diameter and 24 cm in length, with distal and proximal blocking. Once the possible reconstruction options for covering the neurovascular structures and the fracture line had been evaluated, we decided to transpose the ipsilateral latissimus dorsi muscle-cutaneous flap.  With the patient in the right lateral decubitus position, we delineated the flap area with a length of 22 cm x 11 cm width; in order to restore elbow flexion function, we took only the lateral portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle on the same side as the injury. The lateral border of the latissimus dorsi muscle is incised to achieve adequate exposure, and the elliptical incision corresponding to the skin component of the flap is continued. We continue the dissection cephalad over the anterior surface of the muscle up to the subscapularis area, performing submuscular dissection in the areolar plane close to the chest wall.  We locate the descending branch of the thoracodorsal artery, first identifying the branches that go towards the serratus muscle, and the circumflex scapular artery, which are ligated and divided so that there is no torsion of the pedicle after transposition.  Once the main pedicle of the flap has been located, we proceed to make the medial cut of the muscle, making sure to include only the tissue necessary to cover the defect.  Incise the axillary area in a zigzag fashion, with distal extension along the lateral border of the latissimus dorsi muscle to transpose the latissimus dorsi flap to the anterior aspect of the arm to provide coverage of the fracture tract and vascular repair saphenous grafts. We finished with direct primary closure of the donor site after placement of a closed drainage system.  Once the flap has been transposed, we fix the coracoid process and the remaining fibres of the biceps muscle belly proximally and fix the bicipital tendon distally with non-absorbable nylon 0 sutures.  The remaining muscle flap and fasciotomy were covered with partial thickness grafts 7 days after transposition of the latissimus dorsi flap, once the distal oedema of the extremity had subsided and the granulation tissue showed no clinical signs of bacterial colonisation.  The patient spent 10 days in hospital with adequate distal perfusion of the tissues, and vascularisation of the superficial and deep palmar arch was demonstrated by 8 MhZ hand-held Doppler auscultation. The latissimus dorsi flap, with no evidence of venous congestion or arterial insufficiency, provided stable coverage over the humeral fracture tract and over the saphenous vein grafts to the brachial vessels. The donor area was also uncomplicated, with removal of the closed drainage system at 13 days postoperatively. Graft integration was 100%. The patient started physical therapy 4 weeks after the initial procedure, with flexion and extension movements of the elbow. After a 6-month follow-up, he has flexion and extension ranges between 60-180 degrees, even with some limitation to full flexion function, which will require more physical therapy to be able to perform strenuous work, since daily tasks, such as dressing and studying, can be performed without difficulty.   "
"A 51-year-old woman came to the emergency department with headache of 2 months' duration. The scan showed a lytic lesion measuring 38 x 21 mm involving the left temporal calvarium immediately above the mastoid. The patient's personal history included thermocoagulation of a skin lesion in the same region in another hospital, currently without apparent involvement of the skin. After performing a full body bone extension study and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis, which were negative, we proceeded to surgical excision of the lesion in collaboration with the Neurosurgery Department. The lesion was removed by circumferential en bloc craniectomy including the temporalis muscle and its fascia, with a macroscopic margin of 1 cm. The underlying dura mater had an apparently preserved appearance, without infiltration. A 5 cm acrylic plasty was cast for the bony defect and direct scalp closure was performed.  The excised mass was soft and whitish in consistency and eroded the external and internal table of the temporal bone.  Pathological examination showed a neoplasm in multiple well-defined solid nests separated by fibrous tissue. Inside these nests, atypical epithelium with frequent mitoses was found arranged around central areas formed by keratic material. All these characteristics represent a malignant tumour originating in the hair follicle and specifically a trichofollicular carcinoma.  As a consequence of the most probable origin of the tumour, the history of skin lesion and the fact that the scalp had not been removed in the first operation, we decided to extend the surgery and perform a revision of the bed and resection of the scalp island. The operation was scheduled by the Plastic Surgery Department 2 months after the first operation, but the day before the scheduled date the patient was admitted to the Pneumology Department for haemoptysis, with negative fibrobronchoscopy and CT scan showing pleural thickening, and therefore a follow-up examination was recommended. Given the time that had elapsed, a new control cranial CT scan was performed, which revealed the presence of post-surgical changes with no signs suggestive of local recurrence or lymph node dissemination. Finally, 3 months after the first operation, the patient underwent another operation with extensive resection of the scalp and exposure of the previous surgical site. Intraoperatively we observed the presence of a new lesion of small size, 1 cm, located 1 cm from the posterior edge of the craniectomy and without contiguity with the previous one, with preserved external table but eroding internal table and with apparent dural infiltration. We removed the acrylic plasty, extended the craniectomy, performed circumferential dural resection with margins and repaired the meninx with Neuropatch® plasty. The final bone and skin defect, 12 x 7 cm in diameter, was reconstructed by Plastic Surgery with a free flap of rectus abdominis muscle based on the inferior epigastric artery (TRAM) and free skin grafting of partial skin over the muscle. The location of the tumour at the junction of the middle and posterior third of the skull base made the availability of recipient vessels for the flap more complex. Finally, the anastomoses were made end-to-end to the superior thyroid artery, which was subsequently rotated to reach the pedicle of the flap and the external jugular vein. The anatomopathological study of the excised piece showed infiltration by a tumour with the same characteristics as the primitive one, i.e. a trichofollicular carcinoma in the internal table, diploe and dura mater, with free borders, which curiously did not infiltrate the scalp, epidural tissue or local ganglia. A third surgical intervention was necessary because a new antero-superior parietal lesion without continuity with the previous craniectomy was detected in the control scan in less than 1 month of evolution. We were able to access the upper edge of the previous craniectomy through the incision of the upper edge of the TRAM flap and its extension towards the scalp on the upper temporal line. We extended the craniectomy 4x5 cm antero-superiorly to include the new lesion and the underlying dura with free margins. Closure was performed with another Neuropatch® plasty and acrylic cranioplasty only on the new bone defect (the previous bone defect was completely covered by the TRAM flap).  Both diploe and dura were infiltrated by trichofollicular carcinoma, with negative resection margins. The control cranial and thoracic scan 3 months after the last operation showed no recurrence of local disease and detected the presence of 2 apical pulmonary nodules which were removed by videothoracoscopy. The anatomopathological report was of pulmonary metastases with histological image similar to that of the previous biopsies. In view of this, we assumed the diagnosis of the lung as a metastasis of primary trichofollicular carcinoma of the scalp. As adjuvant treatment, the patient received local radiotherapy centred on the surgical bed and the flap with very good adaptation and evolution: intensity modulated external radiotherapy (IMRT) for 1 month and a half at a rate of 2 sessions per week, using high-energy photons generated by the linear accelerator (SYNERGY®) with a total dose of 12,600 cGy. He also received adjuvant chemotherapy: 6 cycles of CDDP-5FU (cisplatin with fluorouracil) and another 4 cycles of carboplatin-taxol with a good response. Two and a half years after the diagnosis of the primary tumour, and having finished this last cycle of chemotherapy, there are no signs of tumour recurrence, pulmonary, or dissemination to the abdomen or pelvis in the CT scan.

"A 35 year old patient with skin phototype I according to the Fitzpatrick classification presented to the Plastic Surgery Department of our hospital with a clinical history of fibrocystic mastopathy, intracanalicular papillomatosis and cancerophobia due to a family history of breast neoplasia. Mammography showed well-distributed micronodular tissue that was classified as a BIRADS 3 mammographic pattern. Nevertheless, she was admitted for prophylactic breast cancer surgery. At the time of surgery she had no palpable axillary lymph nodes.  We performed a bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy, with the intraoperative finding of a left axillary lymphadenopathy, close to the subcutaneous tissue, black in colour. Given the possibility of the intraoperative discovery of a melanoma metastasis, we decided to refer the sample for deferred anatomopathological study. No other clinical signs suggestive of tumour pathology were found, so the surgery was completed with bilateral placement of breast prostheses.  An exhaustive examination of the patient during postoperative admission revealed no skin lesions compatible with melanoma, but did reveal the presence of a 10-year-old tattoo in the left pectoral region. The patient was discharged from hospital pending the results of the anatomical pathology study.  The deferred histological study of the surgical specimen described the adenopathy as a purplish-coloured, bilobed fragment measuring 1.6 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm, with a purplish tinge. Microscopy showed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. The structure of the lymph node was preserved, without the presence of melanocytic cells and with a deposit of a dark granular artificial pigment.  Once again in the consultation room, the clinical examination together with the histological study of the lesion made it possible to attribute the cause of the clinical changes of the lymphadenopathy to the patient's tattooing, with the consequent result of a benign prognosis and without the need for further treatment or follow-up.

Normal pregnancy and term birth by caesarean section due to pelvic presentation, without postnatal complications. He was referred to the outpatient paediatric plastic surgery department for presenting nasal breathing difficulties due to obstruction of the right nostril by a polyp, as well as a pedunculated intraoral mass in the upper gum between 2 labial frenulae. Normal brain, no hypertelorism, epiphora of the right eye, high palate, well formed uvula and palate.  Computerised axial tomography (CAT) of the skull and facial mass revealed agenesis of the corpus callosum together with a hypodense image in the interhemispheric line at the level of the frontal horns, corresponding to a lipoma with irregular borders measuring 3.8 x 2.1 x 1.7 cm; spina bifida occulta at the level of the cervical spine and central fissure at the level of the maxillary arch.  The electroencephalogram was within normal limits for the patient's age, with no evidence of paroxysmal activity or lesion focus. We performed surgical spindle resection of both the single nasal polyp (irregularly shaped, lobulated, measuring 0.9 x 0.7x 0.5 cm) and the intraoral polyp (measuring 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm). The anatomopathological study reported keratinised squamous polyps with the presence of pilosebaceous adnexa and fibroadipose tissue, with few mucinous glands and no immature or malignant components.  The outpatient follow-up of the patient up to the age of 1 year and 8 months at the time of publication of this article has been favourable and without complications. Neurologically, despite presenting agenesis of the corpus callosum, he remains alert with psychomotor development in accordance with his age and without seizures. The chromosomal study was male 46 XY with normal karyotype.   "
"A 53-year-old Negroid woman aged 53 years, morbidly obese: body mass index (BMI) 41kg/m2, and marked asymmetry of volume of the lower limbs, with an exuberant volume of the right leg in which the presence of amphractuosities in the cutaneous-adipose tissue of the dorsum of the right foot stands out.  We proposed a diagnosis of secondary chronic lymphoedema of probable infectious aetiology due to filaria, given that the patient had previously resided in Guinea Bissau where filariasis is endemic, and we classified it as stage IV according to the clinical staging system of Campisi-Michelini et al (6). The patient was admitted for treatment by elevation of the limb and optimisation of skin hygiene, and then underwent surgery, the Charles technique being performed with excision of the affected area of the dorsum of the foot over an area of 16 x 11 cm and coverage with a partial skin graft taken from the inner side of the same leg. It is important to note that we preserved the skin of the interdigital space to prevent the later appearance of scar flanges.  Postoperatively, the patient presented lymphatic drainage in the operated area without loss of the net graft, with drainage occurring through the fenestrations. She remained in hospital for a period of 15 days, with the limb elevated and with daily dressings until the lymphatic exudation ceased. During admission she completed a 15-day course of antibiotic therapy, which we continued prophylactically on an outpatient basis for a further 2 weeks until healing was complete. After 2 weeks she began to wear elastic stocking compression for 24 hours during the first 3 months and then only during the day for her daily activities to prevent recurrence.  The patient showed a reduction in the volume of the foot as well as an improvement in mobility and skin hygiene. She was followed up in consultation every 3 months in the first year and every 6 months in the second year, until definitive discharge 2 years postoperatively.   "
"An 8-day-old female neonate, preterm at 36 weeks, high birth weight (3,600 g), suffering from peripartum asphyxia with moderate-severe neonatal encephalopathy. Due to peripartum asphyxia, she was treated at the regional hospital of origin with systemic hypothermia using the CritiCool® system (MTRE, Mennen Medical Corp, USA). Eight days after admission, he was transferred to the Paediatric Monitoring Unit of the Hospital 12 de Octubre. During his stay in this unit he was referred to the Plastic Surgery Department for an early onset dorsal skin lesion. During the assessment we observed a tumour on the back, in the midline, measuring 11x13x4 cm, partially fluctuant, with a central blackish eschar measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. A soft tissue ultrasound was requested to try to establish the diagnosis, which revealed liquefactive fat necrosis. We performed 2 punctures to evacuate the contents without success, so we decided to perform surgical debridement and application of vacuum therapy (Renasys®, Smith&Nephew®, London, UK), on the 11th day of admission. The therapy was set at a pressure of 100 mmHg, with continuous cycles and dressing changes every 72 hours.  The patient underwent surgery after 21 days of treatment with vacuum therapy. At the time of surgery, the wound had a good appearance, with a background of granulation tissue and no exudate. Tissue advancement was performed, leaving a central cruciate area of 1 cm2. The patient was admitted to the Neonatology Department of our hospital and was finally discharged 5 days postoperatively, at the age of 45 days. After 8 months of evolution, the patient has a stable wound, without pain, which allows her to lead a normal life, scoring 2 points on the Vancouver Scar Scale.   "
"A 41-year-old male patient was referred to our clinic for a recurrent tumour lesion on the left side of the base of the neck, 10 cm in diameter, with a central ulcerated area, bleeding and adhering to deep planes. The patient had been diagnosed with solitary neurofibroma for 30 years and was treated on three occasions with partial resection and coverage with an acromial flap and graft. He developed a retractable keloid scar on the left lateral neck area and was treated with 15 sessions of radiotherapy, which caused significant limitation of lateral movements in the cervical area.  We proceeded to perform an imaging study of the lesion by magnetic resonance imaging with coronal and sagittal axial slices in Fast Spin Echo sequence, enhanced in T1, T2, GRE and T1 with gadolinium, finding a solid mass of neoplastic type, with well-defined borders of 10.4x5.8x12. 4 cm in its longitudinal, anteroposterior and transverse axes respectively, occupying the left anterior region of the base of the neck, superior to the sternoclavicular joint, with origin in the upper and medial area of the left pectoral muscle and at the insertion level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the clavicular area. No involvement of vascular structures of the neck or intrathoracic extension was observed. After gadolinium administration, moderate enhancement of the tumour was observed. The patient underwent surgery by the Oncology Department in conjunction with the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department, with preoperative marking for complete resection of the neurofibroma and immediate reconstruction.  The Oncology team carried out the en bloc resection of the neurofibroma, generating a soft tissue defect of 20x10 cm in diameter with exposure of the pectoral muscle, left parasternal area, medial area of the first costal arch and clavicle.  The Plastic Surgery team was in charge of the restoration of the defect by subfascial dissection, with 2.5 x magnification loupes, of an anterolateral free flap of the left thigh based on 2 perforating vessels of the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, with dimensions of 24x11 cm, and pedicle of 12 cm in length, performing termino-terminal anastomosis with nylon 9-0 to superior thyroid vessels contralateral to the lesion and transposition of the acromial flap previously performed to its native location. The donor area of the anterolateral thigh flap was closed by first intention without complications. The coordination of work in 2 teams by Oncology and Plastic Surgery facilitated a total operative time of 5 hours, with the patient not requiring transfusions or a stay in the Intensive Care Unit. Adequate planning, by locating 2 perforating vessels in the left thigh area with a manual 8 MhZ acoustic doppler, ensured that a flap with the necessary dimensions for coverage could be obtained. The histopathological report of the resection piece corroborated the diagnosis of neurofibroma, with dimensions of 16x10.5x6.5 cm, showing mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, Schwann cells, perineural tissue and mast cells, and with deep surgical margins free of lesion.  The patient spent 6 days in hospital, with intravenous antibiotic therapy with cefazolin 1 g every 8 hours, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg once a day orally, and anti-inflammatory/analgesic treatment with ketoprofen 25 mg every 8 hours. We did not immobilise either the recipient or the donor site, and only left open Penrose drainage in the recipient site for 48 hours. We monitored the flap by clinically assessing capillary filling, colour and local temperature every hour for the first 24 hours, and then every 2 hours for a further 48 hours. We also used 8MhZ manual Doppler to assess the patency and permeability of the venous and arterial anastomosis. During the hospital stay there was no evidence of venous congestion or arterial insufficiency, with adequate coverage of the defect created by the resection. We started neck physiotherapy 6 weeks after the operation, based on flexion-extension and lateral neck movements. We followed up the patient in the outpatient clinic every 3 weeks for a period of 18 months, during which time the neck area improved in contour and mobility, with a better aesthetic-functional result and without the need for secondary surgical treatment.   "
"75-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, transient ischaemic attack, autoimmune hypothyroidism and mild cognitive impairment. He suffered a flame contact burn due to inflammation of his clothing by fanning a flame with diesel fuel, as a result of which he had deep dermal and subdermal lesions on both lower extremities, with a total body surface area burned of 20%. The burns were deep dermal on the posterior surface of both thighs and circumferential on both legs, with a plaque of subdermal involvement on the anterior surface of the left leg, as well as superficial dermal burns on the lateral thighs and face. Resuscitation in the first hours after the accident was carried out in a hospital in another region, from where he was referred to the Intensive Care Unit of our hospital for further treatment of the injuries. On the day of admission, we performed emergency escharotomies on both legs and completed initial resuscitation. During the first 3 weeks of hospitalisation we performed 4 sessions of serial debridement of the burned areas and coverage with meshed partial skin autografting of the anterior surface of the thighs in the defects caused by the exeresis of the deepest burns, and with dermal substitutes (Biobrane®) in the debrided areas of superficial burns, on the lateral thighs and in patchy areas of the legs One week postoperatively, we observed the loss of the graft on the anterior surface of the left leg.  In a new surgical session we performed debridement of the left pretibial area, with persistence under the graft of a burn that had not been eliminated during the previous surgeries. After adequate removal of this eschar, we observed a 20 cm long pretibial defect, with exposure of the tibia. The entire exposed periosteum was removed and vacuum therapy was started on the resulting defect. Vacuum therapy was applied using a VAC® device (KCI Clinic Spain SL), in continuous mode, at 125 mmHg. Cures were performed every 72 hours with chlorhexidine soap. No further debridement procedures were necessary in the operating theatre. After 45 days of vacuum therapy we verified complete coverage of the bone by granulation tissue and performed definitive treatment with partial skin autografts taken from the buttocks, after which we achieved complete closure of the wounds.  During the period of therapy, microbiological cultures of the underlying granulation tissue were positive for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which the patient had previously also presented with in urine. We instituted systemic treatment with Imipenem and Cilastatin, and performed partial debridement of the more superficial and hypertrophic granulation tissue during the dressing changes in the room. After completion of the vacuum therapy and grafting of the defect, the patient showed no further signs of graft infection. He was discharged from hospital 100 days after admission, with difficulty in ambulation and rehabilitation treatment on an outpatient basis.   "
"A 38 year old male working as a member of the police force suffers a road traffic accident as a motorcyclist with blunt trauma to the left hand in hyperextension. He was initially seen by the Emergency Department where an X-ray of the hand was taken and no fractures were found, so he was treated with a bandage, analgesia and rest. Two months later, the patient consulted another medical institution for persistent pain and functional limitation; new X-rays were taken showing a fracture of the distal pole of the scaphoid, and he was given closed orthopaedic treatment with a splint for 4 weeks, after which rehabilitation with physical therapy was indicated and continued for 6 months. Treatment was carried out in another medical institution.  One year later, he returned to the medical office again due to persistent pain and functional limitation, and was referred to our Hand Surgery Department, where we requested a computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast of the left hand and wrist, finding necrosis of the distal pole of the scaphoid. With this diagnosis, we decided to perform surgical treatment by means of scapho-trapezoid-trapezoid arthrodesis with plate.   "
"We present the case of a 59-year-old man who consulted for intellectual deficit, convulsions, bradypsychia, disorientation and stupor in the previous days. CT scan without contrast showed a peripheral left frontal lesion of 3.5 cm in diameter, with a broad base and mass effect, accompanied by trans-subzyphoidal herniation, collapse of the third ventricle and dilatation of the lateral ventricles. These findings were interpreted as the presence of a left frontal lobe menigioma and a resection was performed in December 2000. The pathological anatomy was reported as meningeal osteosarcoma (Macroscopy: 5.2x4.5 cm partially calcified mass. Microscopy: Well demarcated osteogenic tumour, without parenchymal infiltration. Irregular bone trabeculae containing atypical areas, well-differentiated areas with osteoclastic cells, necrosis and haemorrhage). The 99mTecnetium scan was positive in the surgical field, laboratory tests were normal and the body CT scan showed paralysis of the left hemidiaphragm and hydrothorax. Referred to our unit and having ruled out metastatic involvement, the patient started an adjuvant QT programme, but after a first cycle of cisplatin and adriamycin, the MRI showed the persistence of a frontal meningeal neoplasm surrounded by a collection of blood, with mass effect and ventricular collapse. A second resection with wide margins was performed and the pathologist reported in the specimen the persistence of an osteosarcoma of the dural meninx, with infiltration of brain tissue and bone. An adjuvant QT regimen was scheduled with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, bleomycin 15 mg/m2 and actinomycin-D 0.6 mg/m2 (day 1/21 days) and weekly methotrexate, which the patient discontinued of his own volition after the first cycle. For this reason, adjuvant RT was administered from March to May 2000, 50 + 14 Gy (5x2 Gy/weekly) of 60Cobalt. The patient continued to undergo check-ups until May 2003, when a local relapse was discovered by MRI, and he was sent to the neurosurgery department of the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga. On 11-05-2003, referring intellectual deficit and urinary incontinence, he underwent a new CMRI which showed an expansive frontoparietal process, extending to the right frontal lobe and corpus callosum, and a thoracic CT scan which showed multiple metastatic nodules in both lungs. Treatment with surgery, QT and RT was ruled out, and high-dose corticosteroids were administered, achieving an initial improvement. However, on August 30, 2003, the patient came to the emergency room of our centre, presenting severe deterioration of consciousness, with a Karnoffsky index of 30%, dyspnoea and thrombosis of the left femoral system, with multiple pulmonary metastases seen in the chest X-ray. Once stabilisation was achieved, active oncological treatment was ruled out and the patient was referred to our Palliative Care Unit.   "
"A 24-year-old drug addict, HIV-negative woman with a 9-month history of nodular pulmonary infiltrates with a clinical diagnosis of possible granulomatosis. She presented 1 month ago with fever and abdominal pain due to a right adnexal mass. On examination, a 12 cm right ovarian mass was seen, together with another 2 cm mass in the middle of the transverse colon, which was removed. At the same time, the patient reported a 4 cm tumour on the right thigh, located deep in the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The ovarian tumour and the mesenteric nodule had a lobulated external surface, the section surface of which showed solid and cystic areas. In the ovary, the cells were predominantly epithelioid in morphology with prominent nucleolus and diffuse growth pattern with small cystic spaces or pseudofollicles. In the mesenteric nodule a spindle cell morphology predominated. Alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas were observed. There were extensive and frequent areas of geographic necrosis with a tendency to preserve those tumour cells surrounding the vessels resulting in a peritheliomatous pattern. At higher magnification, the spindle-shaped tumour cells showed an oval nucleus and a non-prominent nucleolus. More than 10-20 mitoses per 10 high magnification fields were observed. Immunophenotypically the tumour expressed vimentin, S-100, HMB-45 and actin. Staining for S-100 was intense and diffuse. The tumour did not express epithelial markers or other markers such as CD 117, CD 68, CD 99, collagen IV, oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and inhibin. The thigh tumour subsequently removed was unrelated to the epidermis and histologically superimposable to the ovarian tumour. The distribution of the tumour nodules, the combination of histological patterns and the immunohistochemical profile was consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma, originating from a primary tumour of unknown origin as the patient was scanned and no worrisome pigmented lesions were found and there was no evidence of regression of one of them.  Treatment with chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Interleukin II, Dacarbazine and Interferon alfa) was started and 3 months later, the patient died developing multiple abdominal metastases, including a 13 cm contralateral ovarian mass, retroperitoneal adenopathies and multiple subcutaneous metastases.   "
"We present the case of a 50-year-old male patient with a crisis of profuse sweating, loss of 10% of body weight and pain in the left knee, without fever, of six months' evolution, who consulted for pain and enlargement of the left thigh. His laboratory tests (including LDH) showed no abnormal values and, clinically, he was diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the left trochanter. Radiology of the pelvis showed a single lytic lesion in the left femoral head confirmed by CT, 99Tc and 67Ga scintigraphy. Bone biopsy was reported as lymphoproliferative bone involvement with the possibility of HL. One month later, referred to our Oncology Unit, the physical examination revealed an adenopathic mass of 7 cm in diameter in the left axilla and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathies of months of evolution. Previous symptomatology was interpreted as B symptoms and new laboratory data showed a b2µglobulin of 5 mg/l, LDH 670 and negative serology for HIV and hepatovirus. The axillary mass was biopsied and reported as nodular sclerosis type HL. The lymph node architecture was distorted by fibrous tracts between nodules of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, histiocytes and CD-30+ cells, with clear cytoplasm and lobulated nuclei. There was focal positivity for CD-15 and EMA and almost all tumour cells were Ki-67+. Bone marrow biopsy was reported as fibrosis associated with LH infiltration. CT scan showed lymphadenopathy in the left axilla, supraclavicular, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, pelvis and groin. From 24-2-2000 to 29-9-2000, the patient received seven cycles of QT in ABVD regimen. By the second cycle, the B symptoms and peripheral adenopathies had disappeared. By the fourth, the ß2µglobulin (1.7 mg/l) and LDH (398) values were normal, and by the sixth, the CT scan showed only sclerosis of the left iliac blade, the bone marrow biopsy showed no LH infiltration and the 67Gallium scan was negative. On 15-1-2001, the response was consolidated with 3 cycles of QT in MOPP regimen and RT (36 Gy) on the left femur. To date, the patient is free of relapse. QT regimens used in the treatment ABVD (every 2 weeks): Doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 + Bleomycin 10 mg/m2 + Vinblastine 6 mg/m2 + Dacarbazine 375 mg/m2. COPP (every 4 weeks): Day 1: Cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m2 + Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 + Procarbazine 100 mg/m2. Day 8: Cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m2 + Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2. Days 1-14: Prednisone 40 mg/m2.

"The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia, who comes to our centre after noticing a non-painful tumour in the left breast, which she refers to as having developed approximately one month ago. On examination, a solid, hard, poorly demarcated, fixed tumour of approximately 4 cm in diameter adhering to deep planes was palpated in the inner-inner quadrant of the left breast. A mammographic study of both breasts was performed without being able to clearly appreciate the mass as it was in a deep plane. The ultrasound study revealed a hypoechogenic and heterogeneous mass measuring approximately 28 x 30 mm with signs of malignancy, irregular borders and posterior acoustic shadow. A clinical tru-cut microbiopsy of the lesion was performed and histology showed a malignant infiltrative neoformation of fusocellular character surrounding non-neoplastic acinar ductal structures.  Malignant spindle cell neoplasms of the breast raise the differential diagnosis mainly between metaplastic spindle cell carcinomas and sarcomas, so complete excision of the lesion is indicated and the definitive diagnosis is deferred to histological study of the lesion. Given the patient's age and after assessing her wishes and the therapeutic possibilities, surgical treatment was decided, and an infero-medial quadrantectomy was performed without axillary lymphadenectomy. The histological size of the neoplasm is 5 x 4.8 x 3.5 cm, with infiltration of the skin and skeletal muscle and microscopically shows an infiltrating neoplastic proliferation made up of spindle cells arranged in irregular fascicles with abundant areas of necrosis and variable cell density. The neoplastic cells show marked nuclear atypia, hyperchromasia and abundant mitoses. In none of the areas studied is neoplastic ductolobulillar epithelium visible or forming part of the lesion and the few ducts observed appear to correspond to non-neoplastic structures infiltrated by the tumour.  In the immunohistochemical study the neoplastic cells are strongly positive for keratins AE1-AE3, cytokeratin 22, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, Cerb-2 and CD10 and negative for keratin 903, EMA, cytokeratin 7, CD31, CD34, p63, total actin, desmin, myosin, CD68, protein S-100 and HMB45. Hormone receptors for oestrogen and progesterone are negative.  Based on all these data, a diagnosis of metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma was established. The patient showed no signs of residual tumour and adjuvant radiotherapy treatment was decided at a dose of 60 Gy, at 2 Gy per fraction, in 5 fractions per week. The patient is currently asymptomatic, two months after the end of treatment.   "
"An 80-year-old woman reported the presence of a lump in her left breast for sixteen years which she had been reluctant to consult for fear of the diagnosis and possible treatments. Although she reported that at first the growth had been slow and indolent, in the last two years it had progressed to the point of self-amputation of the breast. She had finally come to the clinic encouraged by her relatives after presenting with progressive back pain and dyspnoea, more evident in the previous weeks. At that time she had ipsilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathies. Chest X-ray showed signs of pleural effusion and probable carcinomatous lymphangitis. Bone scintigraphy showed multiple uptakes. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by puncture of a nodule protruding above the breast bed; cytology was compatible with infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The patient started treatment with tamoxifen. Two days later she suddenly presented with a significant worsening of her back pain, which necessitated an increase in analgesia. Over the next two weeks, the patient herself gradually withdrew the analgesics until they were discontinued. After a transient elevation, both CA153 and alkaline phosphatase decreased to normal levels. After six months, the lymphadenopathies had completely resolved, although a small remnant remained in the breast bed; the scintigraphy showed some attenuation of the hypercaptured areas and there was a clear improvement in the pulmonary involvement. The patient remained responsive for 22 months. After progression she received several lines of hormonal treatment. She died 56 months after diagnosis.   "
"In February 2000, a 32 year old man came to the hospital emergency department for pain in the left shoulder and lumbar spine. Routine physical examination and laboratory tests were irrelevant. The radiological study showed generalised lytic bone lesions. Abdominal thoracic CT scan showed no images suggestive of visceral neoplasia. Gastroscopy, barium enema, abdominal, testicular and prostate ultrasound were normal. In order to establish a diagnosis, a bone marrow biopsy was taken from the iliac crest. Microscopically, the bone marrow showed a partial replacement of its usual cellularity by a neoplasm consisting of epithelial nests in a fibrous stroma in some areas, while in other areas these nests are surrounded by the usual bone marrow cellularity and are made up of polygonal cells with rounded or oval nuclei, with a soft appearance without prominent nucleoli and very few mitoses. The immunohistochemical study showed negativity for oestrogen receptors, S-100 protein, HMB45, p53, bc1-2 and synaptophysin. Positivity in 25% of the nuclei with MIB-1 and in 90% of the nuclei with p27 and diffuse and strong positivity to progesterone receptors, chromogranin A, neuronal specific enolase, carcinoembryonic antigen and in less than 50% of the cells to calcitonin, amyloid was not detected with Congo Red staining. With these elements, a diagnosis compatible with bone metastasis of medullary thyroid carcinoma was made. Serum calcitonin levels were 3,500 pg/ml (normal 15-100) and CEA 231 ng/ml (normal 0.01-5), with serum levels of Ca 125, Ca 19.9 and PSA being normal.  Given the poor physical condition of the patient, he was sent to the oncology department of our reference hospital in Jaén, where a small solid thyroid nodule with calcium was found ultrasonographically in the left lobe, which was not removed. After investigating the family, no history of thyroid pathology was found. A first line of chemotherapy (CDDP-ADR-VP16) was administered for 6 months, with no response. Palliative radiotherapy was also given to the dorsal lumbar spine. At the beginning of February 2001, a second line of chemotherapy (CTX-DTIC) was started, which was suspended a few days later due to the patient's poor condition, progression of bone metastases and the appearance of pulmonary metastases. The patient died on 21 February 2001. The family did not authorise the autopsy.   "
"A 20-year-old patient attended the emergency department with lumbar pain and fever. The patient underwent urine cultures, blood cultures and a tumour marker study (tests that were negative). A computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan detected a tumour mass affecting the upper pole of the right kidney. The tumour was then surgically resected.  The surgical resection specimen consisted of a tumour mass 14 cm in diameter, with infiltration of the upper pole and middle segment of the kidney, and involvement of the sinus and pyelocaliceal system. The presence of tumoural lymphatic vascular invasion was observed in the renal tissue and adjacent fat. Medullary metastasis of the adrenal gland, invasion of the perirenal fat and nodules of the interaortic caval chain. Using immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin sections with different monoclonal antibodies (Dako), the following staining pattern was found to be compatible with a desmoplastic small round cell tumour: cytokeratins 8, 18 and 19 (+), glial fibrillary acidic acidic protein (-), desmin (+), vimentin (+), synaptophysin (+), chromogranin (-), actin (weakly +), and S-100 (weakly +).  A cytogenetic study of the t(11;22) (p13;q12) translocation involving the EWS1 and WT1 genes was also performed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using the LSI EWSR1 (22q12) Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (VYSIS) kit. This consists of a mixture of two probes that completely flank the EWS1 gene locus, the more centromeric probe is labelled with Spectrum-Orange and the more telomeric with Spectrum-Green. As a result of this design, any translocation involving the EWS1 locus results in the separation of the red-green fusion signal into a red and a green signal. The pattern observed in our case corresponds to the normal pattern, with the presence of two red-green fusion signals per tumour cell, thus confirming the absence of translocation in the patient.  The patient was treated with three cycles of CAV, four cycles of Ifosfamide/VP-16, and subsequently CTX, ADR, and VCR. As a result of this treatment no tumour infiltration was detected in the bone marrow. However, a reappearance of the tumour and liver metastasis was subsequently detected by CT scan. After which there was no response to treatment and the patient died two years after the initial diagnosis.   "
"A 34 year old female patient with a history of maternal grandfather who died of lung carcinoma. Sinusitis seven years earlier. She consulted her ENT specialist for a clinical history of 14 months with rapidly progressive rhinorrhoea and epistaxis. Rhinoscopy revealed a mass in the right nostril with a polypoid appearance, very bloody on contact, which occupied the entire right nostril and appeared to connect with the septum and middle turbinate, extending to the choana and occupying the nasopharynx. The biopsy was positive for stesioneuroblastoma. A CT scan of the head and neck showed a 4-centimetre (cm) polypoid mass with a large pedicle in the right nostril and cavum. The MRI of the head and neck showed a space-occupying lesion that conspicuously obliterated the cavum and extended from the level of the nostrils towards the back, coming into contact with the prevertebral musculature, without infiltrating it, and well delimited.  A CT scan of the thorax and a bone scan without pathology are performed as an extension study. She was classified as Kadish Stage C. She underwent functional endoscopic surgery and the pathological anatomy showed stesioneuroblastoma. The postoperative CT scan showed a polypoid thickening of the mucosa in the right maxillary sinus, with no evidence of malignancy, at the level of the right frontal sinus.  Adjuvant treatment with external radiotherapy was decided, using a Linear Accelerator with 6 and 15 MV photons, with tissue compensation wedges after virtual simulation and 3D planning on individualised helical CT. The tumour bed received a global dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, with a schedule of 2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions per week. Tolerance was good, with maximum cutaneous G1, mucosal G2 and oropharyngeal G2 toxicity. Currently, 6 months after irradiation, the complete response has been maintained.   "
"In 1995, at the age of 40, she underwent mastectomy with axillary dissection in another city. The histological report was infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The maximum diameter of the primary tumour was 3 cm (T2). Fourteen nodes were isolated from the axilla, four of which were infiltrated by the tumour; further data on hormone receptors were not available. After the operation she received complementary chemotherapy with six cycles of FEC. In 2000 she began to suffer epigastric pain accompanied by a weight loss of more than 10 kg. In November 2000, gastroscopy revealed a tumour-like mass in the gastric body. The biopsy was reported as diffuse adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells. In January 2001, a laparotomy was performed, in which ascites and an unresectable gastric neoplasm through the stomach wall and infiltrating the head of the pancreas were found. Ascitic fluid cytology was compatible with signet ring cell invasion. He then started cytostatic treatment with chemotherapy. In December 2001, she began to suffer from back pain; bone scintigraphy showed multiple uptakes compatible with bone metastases, which were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Since then she has been treated with analgesic radiotherapy and has also received various lines of chemotherapy and hormonal treatment, which she is still undergoing. The patient's prolonged survival encouraged further gastric biopsy studies which confirmed the presence of oestrogen and progesterone receptors in signet ring cells.   "
"A 42-year-old woman consulted for a history of headache of 10 days' duration accompanied by gait instability. History of migraine, peripheral facial paralysis ""a frigore"" 20 years ago and episodes of depression. The neurological examination showed a right dysmetria and a positive Romberg's manoeuvre and sequelae of his facial paralysis. Cranial CT scan showed an expansive process occupying the right posterior hemifosa. The lesion had a solid component that was enhanced by contrast material and a cystic component. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the findings of the CT scan. A lesion of about 4 cm in diameter was found with a solid and a cystic component, surrounded by oedema, located in the right cerebellar hemisphere. This mass was heterogeneous and hypointense in relation to the cerebellar tissue on T1 and hyperintense on T2. It was enhanced with Gadolinium. It was not accompanied by hydrocephalus.  The tumour was excised almost completely by means of a craniectomy of the right posterior hemifosa. Postoperative evolution was satisfactory and the patient remained completely asymptomatic. A control brain MRI scan showed a wide resection of the tumour with a minimal remnant in the most cranial portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere next to the brainstem. The anatomo-pathological study diagnosed a Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) with extensive areas of necrosis and abscessation. The tumour cells showed nuclear immunohistochemical positivity for p53.  Subsequently the patient was treated with focal radiotherapy in the posterior fossa 60 Gy, 2 Gy/d ICRU (International Commission on Radiation Units) concomitant with Temozolomide 75 mg/m2 according to the EORTC 22981 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) scheme. Eight months after the intervention, the patient remained asymptomatic, although the control brain MRI showed the onset of tumour recurrence.   "
"A 77-year-old man with no history of interest. He consulted for reddening of the skin in the upper third of the chest and proximal part of both limbs together with proximal muscle weakness in the arms and legs, heliotrope erythema on the eyelids and purplish papules on the knuckles of both hands, of one month's evolution. Laboratory tests showed creatinkinase 736 IU, LDH 545 IU, urea 63 mg/dl, CA 19.9 64.1 U/ml. Electromyogram: findings compatible with inflammatory myopathic process. Muscle biopsy: inflammatory changes compatible with dermatomyositis. With the diagnosis of dermatomyositis, treatment was started with prednisone 60 mg/day and study: thoracoabdominal CT scan: 6 cm pancreatic mass and hypodense hepatic lesions. Hepatic puncture-biopsy: Adenocarcinoma. Referred to Oncology. After 8 weeks of corticoids, with no improvement in the skin lesions or muscle weakness, and in view of the diagnosis of stage IVB pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to liver metastases, we started treatment with gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days. After 2 cycles of treatment, complete resolution of the skin lesions, normalisation of muscle enzymes and recovery of strength were documented. Currently the patient remains asymptomatic after 6 cycles of treatment and with less than 50% response to his baseline disease.   "
"Patient aged 53 years at the time of diagnosis with a personal history of a caesarean section, arterial hypertension and tachycardia treated with Atenolol, who came to the Emergency Department with a 5-month history of progressive dull pain in the left flank and microhaematuria. Ultrasound and then abdominal-pelvic computerised axial tomography (CAT) scans revealed a large solid mass measuring 20x16x13 cm arising from the left renal pole, without associated venous thrombosis. Para-aortic adenopathies were also observed. All this was compatible with a left renal tumour.  In view of this finding, an extension study was carried out with a general analysis showing mild iron-deficiency microcytic anaemia and hyperuricaemia, a normal chest X-ray, a bone scan showing an image with a slight increase in tracer uptake corresponding to soft tissue, with a rounded morphology, located in the hypochondrium and in the hypochondrium, located in the left hypochondrium and void, exceeding the midline, and 3 foci of tracer uptake, one in the left iliac blade, the second in the left hemivertebrae L4 and L5 and the third at the level of the right hemivertebra L2, which could correspond to bone involvement due to contiguity or be metastatic, and an abdominal MRI scan which confirms the findings of the CT scan. With the presumptive diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with retroperitoneal adenopathy, the patient underwent radical left nephrectomy, removal of all the pararenal fat and the left adrenal gland and para-aortic and interaortocaval lymphadenectomy from the renal artery to 3 cm from the common iliac artery. Removal of the mass was difficult due to infiltration of the transverse mesocolon and tail of the pancreas, which were released, leaving the mesocolon untouched. The anatomo-pathological (A.P.) result was as follows: Collision renal tumour (Leiomyosarcoma (21 x 15 cm) and renal carcinoma papillary type nuclear grade 3 (7 x 3.5 cm)). The weight of the whole specimen was 2539 grams. The tumour was in contact with the surgical edge in most areas. The renal parenchyma was microscopically respected and no tumour infiltration was observed. The ureteral fragment and renal hilum were free of tumour infiltration. The immunophenotypic profile of the tumour was as follows: Actin, Desmin, S-100, Synaptofusin and CD 56 and c-kit negative; Smooth muscle actin positive in the sarcomatous zone and keratin cocktail (E1, E3) positive in the carcinomatous zone. At the level of the para-aortic chain, 16 adenopathies were isolated, the largest measuring 2.5 cm, with metastases in 14 of them, 13 from the carcinoma and 1 with mixed metastases (sarcoma+carcinoma). Six adenopathies were isolated in the interaortocaval chain, the largest measuring 1.4 cm, three of which were carcinoma metastases. The mesocolic bed was infiltrated by leiomyosarcoma. In the perisuprarenal adipose tissue 4 adenopathies were isolated, 3 of them with metastasis of the carcinoma and another with mixed metastasis (carcinoma+sarcoma). The left adrenal gland, the perirenal fat and the gall bladder showed no tumour elements.  We were therefore faced with a renal collision tumour consisting of a stage IV papillary type renal cancer (pT3-4pN2) according to the TNM classification and a stage IV renal leiomyosarcoma (pT2bpN1) according to the AJCC classification, not radically resected and with possible bone metastases according to bone scintigraphy. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was referred to the Medical Oncology Department. It was decided to propose complementary chemotherapy treatment with Ifosfamide 5 g/m2 in a continuous infusion of 24h x 1 day + Adriamycin 60 mg/m2 x 1 day/21 days against the sarcomatous component of the tumour. A CT scan was previously requested in which a small soft tissue enlargement was observed behind the pancreatic tail and renal bed, which could be compatible with present disease. The patient started treatment according to the planned schedule 3 weeks after surgery. She received a total of 6 cycles with good clinical tolerance. After the 4th cycle, an abdominal CAT scan was performed, which was normal, and at the end of the 6th cycle, a bone scan was performed, which showed no pathological findings. The patient underwent regular check-ups and 3 months later a chest X-ray was performed showing images suggestive of bilateral pulmonary metastases, which were confirmed by a CT scan showing multiple bilateral millimetric pulmonary metastases. In order to identify the origin of these metastases, Thoracic Surgery was consulted and it was decided to perform a left videothoracoscopy with biopsies. The P.A. diagnosis was metastasis of poorly differentiated carcinoma with an epithelial component (renal). In view of this diagnosis, 6 months after finishing the first chemotherapy regimen, it was decided to start a second line of treatment with a chemotherapy regimen with Gemzitabine and Fluoropyrimidines9 that had proved useful in stage IV renal carcinoma: Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 + Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2/12h days 1-14/21 days, which the patient accepted.  Treatment was started with a 20% dose reduction which was maintained for the rest of the treatment given the patient's general condition (ECOG: 1-2). After the second cycle, the patient suffered a complication of pulmonary thromboembolism from which she recovered but which caused a delay of 4 weeks in the administration of the third cycle. After 6 cycles of treatment, which she received with acceptable tolerance except for grade 4 anaemia, she was re-evaluated with a body CT scan which showed persistent pulmonary metastases with the appearance of liver and spleen metastases and local relapse. In view of this progression, treatment with IL-2 was proposed for 6 weeks (1 week of induction with 18 Million Units (MU) x 5 days and 5 weeks: 9 MU days 1 and 2 and 18 MU days 3 to 5)10. The patient accepted the treatment with moderate toxicity with secondary constitutional symptoms grade 2, anaemia grade 3 and emesis grade 1, maintaining her general condition. At the end of treatment, a new re-evaluation was performed with a CT scan showing progression of the disease with a large mass in the surgical site measuring 19x10x5cm, which had grown with respect to the previous CT scan, and persistent metastases in the rest of the previous sites. The patient's general condition worsened, with the appearance of abdominal and lumbar pain, and on physical examination a 5cm epigastric mass was palpated, corresponding to the underlying mass. Given this new progression, it is considered that the tumour is resistant to chemotherapy or immunotherapy schemes against renal carcinoma and it is proposed to start palliative treatment with liposomal Adriamycin against the sarcomatous component of the tumour. The patient accepted the proposal and received a first cycle. However, a week later she went to the emergency department for hypovolemic shock with metabolic acidosis and pre-renal renal failure secondary to hyperemesis of 4 days' evolution and grade 4 anaemia. The patient recovered from this episode but a week later she began with faecal vomiting of probable obstructive origin due to compression of the retroperitoneal mass, causing progressive deterioration of the patient and the patient died of multi-organ failure 19 months after diagnosis.   "
"The patient is a 71 year old woman, who has been a former smoker for 25 years, is diagnosed with hypertension, polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis. In 1988, following a study for metrorrhagia, an endometrial tumour was detected and a hysterectomy and double adnexectomy were performed. The pathology study showed that it was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (grade I), with infiltration of the inner third of the myometrium, without evidence of infiltration of blood or lymphatic vessels, with a negative extension study, therefore stage Ib. She subsequently received radiotherapy with cobalt-60 in the pelvis and brachytherapy in the vaginal vault. She underwent periodic check-ups with no evidence of relapse. In 2003, she consulted for irritative cough and slight haemoptotic expectoration, and a simple chest X-ray showed a mass in the left upper lobe. With the suspicion of a bronchogenic neoplasm, the studies were completed and a thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed, showing a necrotic mass measuring 8 cm in the LSI with atelectasis of this lobe with no other alterations. Bronchoscopy was performed which revealed a tumour in the anterior segment of the aforementioned lobe, the BAS and bronchial biopsy being compatible with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. With the clinical diagnosis of T2 N0 M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, it was decided to start neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with the scheme Carboplatin (AUC 6) plus Paclitaxel (200mg/m2) every three weeks. After three cycles of treatment, a partial response was observed in radiological studies and the patient underwent left upper lobectomy and lymphadenectomy. Analysis of the surgical specimen showed a tumour corresponding to adenocarcinoma with poorly differentiated areas, with some squamous areas, with positive immunohistochemical results for oestrogen and progesterone expression, and negative for TTF-1 and CK20. These confirmatory results changed the initial approach, as it was not a primary pulmonary tumour as previously thought, but a pulmonary relapse of her endometrial tumour. The patient is being treated with megestrol acetate, with good tolerance, free of disease and is currently being followed up.   "
"A 63-year-old man with no past history of interest. He consulted for presenting a nodular lesion in the right dorso-lumbar quadrant of one month's evolution and rapid growth, associated with asthenia and anorexia for the last three months, with a weight loss of 10 kg. He reported no other symptoms. Physical examination revealed only a slight hepatomegaly. On the right dorsal-lumbar region there was a nodular lesion measuring 5x3 cm, purplish in colour, not adhering to deep layers but painful when rubbed or moved.  Laboratory tests showed urea 74 mg/dl, creatinine 1.93 mg/dl and GGT 83 IU/L with normal GOT/GPT. A chest X-ray showed an elevated left diaphragm and aortic elongation, with no other findings. A biopsy of the skin lesion was performed with an anatomopathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma metastasis. In view of these findings, a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed, which revealed thickening of the oesophago-gastric junction, with left gastric adenopathy >1cm in diameter and liver lesions suggestive of metastasis. Gastroscopy showed a lesion compatible with neoplasia of the cardia. Biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Given the diagnosis of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, the patient started chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin (70mg/m2 every 21 days) and 5-fluorouracil in a 48-hour continuous infusion every week (3 gr/m2, days 1,8,15). This regimen is one of the first-line treatments for this tumour and is included in the guidelines of the Spanish group for the treatment of tumours of the gastrointestinal tract (TTD). After the second cycle, he developed haematological toxicity with febrile neutropenia. He developed septic shock and died in that context.   "
"A 73-year-old man on his first visit to our department, with a history of diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, smoking until 1993, with no known allergies to medication. In July 2001, after several months of rectal discomfort, a PSA level of 16.68 ng/ml was found in routine laboratory tests. Referred from Primary Care to Urology, he was diagnosed by biopsy with Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate in the right lobe, Gleason 3+3 (T1cNxMx, Stage II). After establishing complete androgen blockade (CAB) with Bicalutamide and Leuprorelin, he was referred to our department, where a thoracic-abdominal CT scan was requested to complete the staging. Pending the results of this test, due to the delay in performing it and taking into account the patient's age and the stage of the disease, RT treatment was started. A dose of 70 Gy was programmed on the prostate and seminal vesicles, using 18 MV photons, 4-field box technique and fractionation of 2 Gy/day, 5 days per week. Before the end of treatment, a CT scan was received (11/10/01), which showed a 3 cm solid mediastinal mass, left paraesophageal, superior to the aortic arch, and it could not be differentiated whether it was an adenopathic mass or a primitive neoplasm. In addition, a solid right renal mass, approximately 7 cm in diameter, with central necrosis, suggestive of hypernephroma, was visualised. No vascular alterations, retroperitoneal adenopathies or significant alterations in the pelvis were observed.  Following the results of the CT scan, it was decided to continue irradiation of the prostate, and treatment was completed on 26/11/01. In the meantime, and given that the renal mass did not raise any diagnostic doubts, it was decided to approach the thoracic lesion. On 15/11/01 a mediastinoscopy was performed with biopsies, with the histological result of clear cell carcinoma, compatible with metastasis of renal carcinoma. In agreement with Medical Oncology and Urology, on 21/12/01 a Nephrectomy (NF) was performed, with a definitive histological result of grade II-III renal cell carcinoma, invading perirenal adipose tissue (T3aNxM1, Stage IV). Given the possibility of surgery on the mediastinal metastasis, a new CT scan was performed (30/01/02), in which the presence of the pulmonary mass was confirmed, with an approximate size of 5 x 3 x 4 cm infiltrating the posterior mediastinal region, with no cleavage plane with supra-aortic vascular structures or with the aortic arch, being very close to the upper third of the oesophagus. The right NF was visualised in the abdomen with no signs of recurrence or tumour remnants.  On 27/02/02 an exploratory thoracotomy was performed, with the finding of a 5 cm mediastinal tumour invading the pulmonary parenchyma and the upper face of the aortic arch at the level of an arteriosclerosis plaque that prevented lateral clamping, and was therefore considered unresectable. A biopsy was taken and the diagnosis was confirmed. The possibility of radiotherapy treatment of the mediastinal lesion, whether or not followed by immunotherapy, was raised, but the patient did not accept this possibility and, considering his good general condition, a wait-and-see attitude was adopted. The patient continues with CABG and symptomatic treatment. In June 2002 she received treatment with Megestrol Acetate for ""hot flushes"" secondary to CABG, which was interrupted one month later when the CABG was discontinued. In September 2002 a bone scan was performed, which showed no pathological deposits of the tracer, as well as a PSA determination (0.10 ng/ml) and a new CT scan. This CT scan (12/09/02) showed a mass in the posterior mediastinum, above the aortic arch, measuring 6 x 4 x 4 cm, infiltrating the left subclavian artery, the aorta and the left lung, as well as nodular images in the lingula and right lower lobe adjacent to the spinal column, suggestive of pulmonary metastasis. In the abdomen there were multiple nodular images in the right renal fossa suggestive of recurrence, with probable infiltration of the ipsilateral psoas muscle.  Therefore, and as a conclusion after the last CT scan (9 months after NF), the patient showed clear progression of his disease, with new metastases and local recurrence. In October 2002 he was admitted for clinical suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism, without gammagraphic confirmation. After discharge, he was seen as an outpatient on several occasions, showing a progressive improvement in his general condition.  In September 2003, 21 months after the NF and the patient being asymptomatic, a chest and abdominal CT scan was performed (16/09/03), which only showed several axillary lymphadenopathies of less than 1 cm and the right NF, with no evidence of other lesions - complete radiological response.  Currently (36 months after NF) two subsequent CT scans show the persistence of this response and the patient remains asymptomatic. The prostate tumour continues to be in complete response, with a nadir PSA of 0.10 ng/ml and no alterations in the bone scan.   "
"A 57-year-old man, with a personal history of COPD, smoker of 15 packs/year and moderate drinker, consulted for a fast-growing, painless tumour, firmly adherent to deep planes, of one month's evolution, in the region of the sternal manubrium. Plain X-ray and CT scan with intravenous contrast and three-dimensional reconstruction of the thorax showed a tumour measuring 5-6 cm in diameter in the sternal manubrium with cortical destruction. There were no signs of mediastinal infiltration or infiltration of the clavicles. (See Figures 1 and 2).  General laboratory tests showed no significant alterations, with normal immunoglobulin studies (IgG, IgA, IgM and beta 2 microglobulin). A FNA was performed and a surgical biopsy was performed, finding an atypical cytology that was not conclusive of the histological type. Immunohistochemistry tests were positive for the following markers: CD 138; CD 68 (isolated); LAMBDA (some cells); KAPPA (intense positivity in almost all cells). Plasmacytoma was suspected. Bone scintigraphy only showed increased uptake in the region of the sternal tumour and both sternoclavicular joints. Bone marrow biopsy showed no pathological findings and urine examination revealed the absence of Bence-Jones proteins. Wide en bloc removal of the sternal manubrium and partial resection of both clavicles, the first two ribs and the body of the sternum, including the skin overlying the tumour, were performed. No mediastinal infiltration was observed. Coverage of the resulting defect with a polypropylene mesh and suture of the pectorals in the midline. There were no postoperative complications. The fixation and stability of the chest wall were satisfactory from the immediate postoperative period. Hospital stay was 7 days. The anatomopathological description of the operative specimen indicated abundant mononucleated plasma cells intermixed with multinucleated ones with immunohistochemical positivity for antiCD138 and lambda chain antibodies and negativity for kappa chain antibodies. The resection margins were free of disease. Treatment was completed with radiotherapy (50 Gy in 30 sessions over 4 weeks). At the 6-month postoperative follow-up, no clinical or tomographic signs of disease progression or late postoperative complications were evident.   "
"A 43-year-old man, active smoker of about 15 cigarettes a day. He came to the emergency department with continuous epigastric pain of sudden onset accompanied by nausea and dizziness. Normal bowel habits. She reported similar episodes of lesser intensity that she related to ingestion and that subsided with fasting. Asthenia and moderate anorexia, with weight loss of about 15 kg in the last three months. On examination she was afebrile, BP 80/40, cutaneous-mucosal pallor and the abdomen was soft, depressible, without defence or signs of peritoneal irritation, although painful on palpation in the epigastrium with discreetly increased peristalsis. The CBC showed a Ht° of 30% with a Hb of 11.1 g/dl, the rest being normal. The abdominal X-ray showed dilated jejunal loops with hydroaerial levels. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a ""pseudorenon or sandwich"" image in the sagittal view and a ""bull's eye or doughnut"" image in the axial view. The inner layer was hyperechoic and the outer layer hypoechoic, suspicious of intestinal invagination. Surgical intervention was decided and after anaesthetic induction an abdominal mass located in the mesogastrium was palpated, smooth and mobile. A supraumbilical laparotomy was performed, revealing an intussusception of a jejunal loop that was impossible to reduce, so segmental resection of 30 cm of jejunum was performed, containing a tumour measuring 4 x 4 x 2.5 cm that was reported as anaplastic carcinoma, with a rhabdoid phenotype that invaded the entire wall and infiltrated the subserosal layer. Immunohistochemistry showed high positivity for cytokeratins AE-1/AE-3, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratins 5/6/8/18 and vimentin. Cytokeratin 20, CD-30, CD-31, actin, desmin, CD-117, MELAN-A/M arp-1 and TTF-1 were negative, suggesting a pulmonary origin.  Chest CT confirmed the presence of a right hilar mass of about 4 cm, polylobulated and with spiculated contours, encompassing the upper lobar bronchus but without significant stenosis. Bronchoscopy revealed a thickening of the carina at its separation from the right upper lobar bronchus, with endobronchial tumour that prevented passage of the bronchoscope to the posterior segment. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of an undifferentiated carcinoma with the same immunohistochemical pattern as the intestinal mass.  The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged in good clinical condition. She was subsequently treated with carboplatin AUC 5 day 1, and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2/day days 1 and 8, every 21 days, with partial response after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. Six months after diagnosis, she was admitted for progressive cognitive deterioration secondary to multiple right frontoparietal brain metastases, and died fifteen days later.   "
"48-year-old male, with no history of medical interest or toxic habits, and no known allergies. While working in the warehouse of a nuclear power plant, he was required to unload a lorry carrying 55% hydrazine hydrate. One of the drums accidentally fell to the ground, causing a spillage of about 25 litres, and the company's own emergency services were notified and diluted the 3 m2 area where the spillage had occurred with water. The patient actively participated in the collection of the waste, without using any personal protective equipment; at the end of the task he did not change his clothes or take a shower. Several hours after the accident, he began to notice a reddening of the mouth with cheilitis of the lower lip, oral aphthae and diffuse abdominal pain. He was seen by a medical service, where he was prescribed symptomatic treatment. Six days after the accident, he developed erythematous scaly lesions on his face and arms (areas that were not covered during the accident). He therefore went to a hospital where he underwent a general blood test and simple chest and abdominal X-rays, which were normal, and was prescribed treatment with antihistamines. Two weeks later, he visited the Toxicology Unit of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona on his own initiative, due to persistence of the erythema-squamous lesions, abdominal discomfort and dysgeusia. The physical examination was normal and the blood and urine tests showed only a total bilirubin of 2.5 mg/dl (VN: up to 1.2 mg/dl) with an indirect bilirubin of 2.1 mg/dl. The abdominal ultrasound was normal. He was checked after one and three months and was found to be asymptomatic, although bilirubin remained slightly elevated, and he was discharged from the hospital.   "
"The clinical case is presented of a medical specialist in microbiology, with many years of experience, who accidentally inoculated himself, when performing the antibiogram by the BACTEC MGIT 960 method, with a pure strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, isolated from a sputum sample from an ambulant patient of Spanish origin; he pricked himself on the external lateral side of the distal phalanx of the index finger, piercing the glove with the contaminated needle. At the time of inoculation, he immediately treated the wound (washing with soap and water), and later reported it to the Occupational Risk Prevention Service (SPRL), where the inoculation was recorded as an occupational accident. At the SPRL, the medical-work history of the injured worker was reviewed and it was noted that she had a positive Mantoux test; analyses and serologies were requested for HCV, HIV and quantified post-vaccination antibodies for hepatitis B; the worker was also informed that if any signs or symptoms compatible with tuberculosis or with problems at the site of inoculation, she should consult the SPRL. Three weeks later, an erythematous papule appeared at the inoculation site, slightly painful on pressure, which grew to a size of 1.5-2 cm, without axillary lymphadenopathy or general symptoms. (Image 3)  Image 3. Biopsy of the lesion  When the worker observed that the lesion did not improve, she made an informal consultation with the Plastic Surgery Department, which requested a biopsy and excision of the lesion. The anatomical and pathological findings were granulomatous dermatitis with occasional necrosis, highly suggestive of tuberculous dermatitis. (Image 4)  Pathological anatomy: granulomatous dermatitis, suggestive of tuberculous dermatitis.  In the microbiological study, dubious acid fast bacilli were observed, and when cultured in BACTEC MGIT 960, the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was confirmed. Subsequently, both isolates (from the source and from the injured worker) were studied by MIRU (Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units), confirming the identity of both strains. (Image 5)  Image 5. Microbiological study  The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis was confirmed and the worker was referred to the Internal Medicine Department, where, after being assessed, she began anti-tuberculosis treatment with rifampicin 600 mg, 250 mg of isoniazid and 1500 mg of pyrazinamide on an empty stomach for two months, continuing for a further four months with rifampicin 600 mg and isoniazid 300 mg per day. This service also monitored the patient with monthly analyses in which no alterations were detected, good tolerance to the medication was observed, and she was discharged from the hospital 7 months after starting treatment. The SPRL reports the occupational disease in accordance with RD 1299/2006, of 10 November, which approves the list of occupational diseases in the Social Security system and establishes criteria for their notification and registration.   "
"A 28 year old woman, nursing assistant, attended the emergency trauma department because she reported that for two days she had been experiencing pain in the subpatellar region of the right knee which had been worsening and she was currently having difficulty moving the joint. Physical examination revealed an erythematous lesion in the right subpatellar region, with pain on palpation and a small incised-contuse wound a few millimetres long. Active and passive mobilisation is partially limited by the pain, with no other accompanying symptoms. The worker refers that in childhood she had an osteochondroma in the same knee, currently cured and without sequelae, with the last control X-ray taken two months ago, which was completely normal. The worker relates this episode to a work-related accident suffered two days ago, in which she slipped and fell to the floor while carrying a box of 32 mercury thermometers in her hand. Some of the mercury thermometers fell on her right knee and caused an incised-contuse wound, which we observed on examination still healing. The nursing assistant acknowledges that she was overworked at her workplace. The box in which she was transporting the thermometers was not closed, the worker was not wearing gloves and the work clothes were not removed after the accident at work. Subsequently, no hygienic-sanitary measures were taken and no appropriate action was taken to deal with the mercury spillage. In the emergency department, the next step was to take an X-ray of the knee, which revealed a metallic foreign body in the patellar bursa, corresponding to mercury.  After the diagnosis of chemical bursitis due to mercury, and taking into account the toxicity of the metal, the patellar bursa was removed urgently in the operating theatre under scopia, in order to avoid mercury remains in the worker's joint. Currently, the auxiliary has no sequelae and has fully recovered from her injury.   "
"A 35-year-old man, working in the maintenance of electrical installations, went to the company medical service for a routine check-up. He was asymptomatic. He had been a smoker of 10 cigarettes/day for 8 years. He was not a consumer of alcoholic beverages, had no toxic habits and did not regularly take any medication. He had no family history of sudden death and had no personal history of syncope, lipothymia, convulsions, agonal nocturnal breathing or palpitations. The medical examination revealed no abnormalities in the physical examination or in the routine complementary examinations, with the exception of his baseline ECG.  Suspecting Brugada syndrome, he was referred to the Arrhythmia Unit of Hospital Clínic de Barcelona. After clinical and electrocardiographic assessment and a flecainide test, a diagnosis of BS was made. To complete the risk stratification, an electrophysiological study was also performed, which showed A-H intervals of 128 msec and HV of 44 msec. A ventricular pacing protocol was performed, without induction of sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and therefore, in conjunction with the patient's clinical data, it was concluded that BS was of low arrhythmic risk. Avoidance of the drugs and medications listed in Table 1 and vigorous treatment of any febrile symptoms were recommended, as it has been shown that fever can trigger ventricular arrhythmias in patients with BS6, and a genetic study was also scheduled. Six months later, the patient remains asymptomatic.   "
"Woman, 27 years old, nursing professional in the hospitalisation area of Internal Medicine, suffered an accident at work involving a puncture with abbocath during the working day on 23/11/1989. A review of the clinical case of the source patient and the respective confirmatory tests were carried out, and no information on transmissible diseases was found in the clinical history. The tests carried out on the patient and the worker were negative for viral markers for hepatitis. 15 days later, he presented with a rise in temperature of 40ºC, abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium, of mild intensity, continuous, without irradiation, not relieved by changes in posture or outpatient treatment, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and asthenia. She denied choluria, acholia and jaundice, so she went to the emergency department and it was decided to admit her. During her stay she underwent a blood test and liver enzyme serology, which revealed hypertransaminemia and negative serology for hepatitis A and B (see Table 1). (See Table 1). Medical treatment was started with Konakion®, Lysozyme®, Nervobion® and Polyvalent Human Gamma Globulin, and she was also vaccinated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. With good clinical and laboratory evolution, she was discharged with medical follow-up.  Subsequently, in 1996, she underwent a medical examination at work, and the analytical results were positive for HCV and negative for HIV. In 2004, in view of the worker's personal history of a biological accident in 1989, the source patient was located and the serological control was repeated, resulting positive for the same virus, and the event that occurred 15 years ago could be declared an occupational accident and occupational disease, as the relationship between the source patient and the worker had been demonstrated.   "
"51-year-old woman, nursing assistant, with a history of type I diabetes mellitus and carpal tunnel syndrome. On 20/02/2011, during her working day in the plant, she accidentally spilled liquid while filling a Biguanid® bottle, which spilled all over her body, so she decided to change her entire uniform, keeping her socks and shoes on for the rest of the shift. Subsequently, he presented two blistering lesions in the dorsal region of the 4th toe of the left foot, which were treated and followed by general surgery. Signs of phlogosis and secretion began to appear (see images 1, 2), which was cultured, resulting in the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, and treatment was indicated according to the antibiogram. Despite these measures, it was complicated by oedema and osteomyelitis of the phalanx (see image 3), so it was decided to amputate the affected finger. Once recovered and with the status of transitory incapacity, she was studied with provocation tests, showing the worker's susceptibility to the disinfectant (see image 4). It was proposed to the competent body, the National Institute of Social Security (INSS), as an accident at work and compensation for a non-disabling permanent injury. She continues to work as an auxiliary at the hospital. Image 1  Image 2  Image 3  Image 4 *Images taken from the worker's medical records.   "
"Female, 44 years old, with a history of excision of nodular malignant cutaneous melanoma on the left shoulder (Breslow: 3.9 mm; Clark level IV; pT3bN0M0) in 1998. She was treated with interferon for one year. Controls every 6 months were negative. At 5 years of age, she was admitted to the surgical department for an episode of intestinal occlusion. Abdominal CT scan: invagination of the small intestine. Treatment: urgent surgical intervention: segmental resection of the ileum due to an intraluminal tumour affecting the serosa. More polypoid tumours were palpated but not resected, as no perioperative diagnosis was available during emergency surgery. The postoperative course was correct and without complications. Macroscopic examination: smooth, rosy serous surface, preserved folds and two tumours partially occupying the lumen (3.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 x 4 cm and 1.2 x 1 x 1 x 1 cm). When cut, the surface was solid, homogeneous, brownish with blackish areas and the consistency was soft.  Microscopically: cells with large, eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm with a vesicular nucleus and prominent nucleolus. Focally there was melanin in the cytoplasm. Abundant mitoses were observed. The tumour cells ulcerated the mucosa and diffusely infiltrated the entire intestinal wall and focally the mesentery and in other areas occupied vascular lumina. The tumour cells were positive for the monoclonal antibodies HMB 45 and S-100 protein. Based on the clinical information, the histological image and the result of immunohistochemistry, the definitive diagnosis was metastasis in the small intestine of known cutaneous melanoma. A study was started to assess the surgical option for salvage: small bowel transit, which revealed at least two more lesions in the jejuno-ileal junction, and a PET scan showing uptake in the abdominal midline, with the rest of the study being normal. The patient was readmitted. Intestinal resection of two segments of jejunum and ileum respectively was performed, leaving the patient macroscopically free of disease. The pathological study showed that the tumours had the same histological characteristics as described above.  "
"A 25-year-old woman, with no past history of interest, was studied for a history of abdominal pain predominantly in the right hypochondrium. Physical examination and laboratory tests, including a liver profile, were normal. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which revealed an 8-centimetre, multiloculated, hypoechoic cystic hepatic lesion with hyperechoic areas and calcium, located in hepatic segments 4-5 and with papillary projections towards the hepatic hilum. Given the impossibility of ruling out malignancy, surgical treatment was recommended. The patient underwent surgery and a cystic lesion of about 10 centimetres in diameter was found on the hepatic hilum, in segments 4 and 5, on the portal bifurcation and the middle hepatic vein. A cystopericystectomy with vascular control was performed without exclusion. The postoperative course was favourable and the patient was discharged after one week. The definitive histological diagnosis showed a ciliated liver cyst.   "
"58-year-old woman referred for abdominal discomfort. She was operated on for breast carcinoma in 1996. One year later, in a control ultrasound and abdominal CT scan, a multicystic pancreatic mass was discovered, with negative biopsy aspiration puncture for malignant cells. She was asymptomatic until 2000, when she began to experience dull abdominal pain. Physical examination and laboratory tests were rigorously normal. Blood tumour markers (CEA, Ca 125 and Ca 19.9) were negative. Abdominal ultrasound: multiple cystic formations throughout the pancreatic cell, multitabulated, with a solid component and some with microcalcifications, of varying size, the largest being 3 cm, and with no flow inside. All this was compatible with giant pancreatic cystadenoma. Abdominal CT and MRI with contrast confirmed these findings. Fine needle aspiration of one of the cysts was performed and no malignant cells were observed. Tumour markers in the cystic fluid showed Ca 125: 786 IU/ml (vn: 0-35), Ca 19.9: 174 IU/ml (vn: 0-37), and normal CEA. A diagnosis of giant cystadenoma of the pancreas, probably serous, was made. The patient has not presented any clinical or radiological changes since the first imaging study 6 years ago. After discussing this with the patient and with the Surgery Department, both refused surgical treatment for the moment.   "
"70-year-old man admitted for deterioration in general condition, asthenia, anorexia and weight loss of 1 month's duration. He had undergone surgery for adenocarcinoma of the prostate and had subsequently received several sessions of radiotherapy (total dose 70 Gy), the last of which was 12 months before his admission, in treatment with hormone therapy. Since starting radiotherapy treatment, the patient reports a change in intestinal rhythm, with alternating diarrhoea and constipation and frequent colicky pain, accompanied by urgency and tenesmus of defecation. Physical examination revealed only a soft, depressible, non-painful abdomen, with increased, non-pathological sounds, without obstructive signs, masses or megaliths. There were no adenopathies, fever or other noteworthy findings. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis of 21,720 /mm3 (17.2% neutrophils, 4.1% lymphocytes, 2.4% monocytes and 75.3% eosinophils), ESR 60 mm in the first hour, CRP 38.80 mg/L, ferritin 481 ng/mL, rheumatoid factor 800 as acute phase reactants, hypoalbuminaemia of 2.2 g/dL without alteration of other markers of malabsorption. Transaminases and cholestasis enzymes were normal. Anti-nuclear, anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies were negative and PSA was 0 ng/mL. Stool parasitology in 3 conveniently collected samples was also negative. Chest X-ray showed no significant alterations. Colonoscopy was performed and the mucosa of the 30 cm explored showed a tubular fibrotic appearance with erythematous stippling, with regular fibrotic stenosis at this level that prevented progression. Multiple biopsies were taken showing acute and chronic non-specific inflammation, with no evidence of eosinophils at any level, and the presumptive diagnosis was actinic colitis.  Abdominopelvic CT scan with intravenous contrast showed diffuse thickening of small bowel loops at the level of the distal jejunum and ileum, with no other alterations. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy at any level or abdominal masses, with radical prostatectomy and thickening of the perirectal fat, bladder wall and rectum, probably related to previous radiotherapy. Due to the alterations in the loops, an intestinal transit was performed which showed a discrete thickening of the connivent valves at the level of the jejunum, with loops of pelvic ileum of reduced calibre, with separation from both the jejunum and the rest of the ileum due to parietal thickening, all compatible as a first possibility with actinic enteritis, and the last ileal loop being of normal calibre with preserved folds.  Given that the scans performed pointed to radiotherapy as the origin of the abdominal symptoms, and other causes of secondary peripheral eosinophilia having been reasonably ruled out, empirical treatment was prescribed with corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 1 week, with a subsequent tapering regimen for 3 months) and parenteral nutrition, given the progressive deterioration of the patient's general condition. This treatment completely resolved both the clinical picture and the analytical alterations, which ruled out the central origin of the eosinophilia. One week after starting treatment, the patient was discharged with a CBC showing 5,280 leukocytes/mm3 with 1% eosinophils, ESR 27 mm in the first hour and CRP 0.76 mg/L, with the diagnosis by exclusion of actinic enteritis and secondary peripheral eosinophilia. He remained asymptomatic and with normal laboratory tests.  "
"A 67-year-old hypertensive patient with no history of gastroduodenal ulcus or intake of gastrolesive drugs, who consulted the emergency department for melena and progressive fatigue of about two weeks' duration. Laboratory tests showed a Hb of 9.8, with pallor on physical examination, normotensive and acceptable general condition with negative rectal examination. An upper endoscopy showed a large submucosal lesion in the gastric fundus, excavated in the centre by a fibrinous ulceration with no signs of current or recent active bleeding. It was interpreted as an ulcerated gastric submucosal lesion, most probably leiomyomatous, responsible for the gastrointestinal bleeding.  Radial echoendoscopy confirmed the submucosal nature of the lesion, which was dependent on the fourth layer of the gastric wall (muscularis propria), hypoechogenic, homogenous, with delimited borders and a maximum diameter of 4.6 x 3.4 cm. Its border on the face of the gastric lumen showed an excavation secondary to an ulcer of about 2 cm in size. No perilesional or celiac trunk lymphadenopathy was observed. An echoendoscopic diagnosis was made of a gastric submucosal stromal tumour (GIST tumour) of probable muscular lineage. With this diagnosis and due to the echoendoscopic criteria of size (greater than 4 cm) and haemorrhagic complication, elective surgical treatment was performed by resection and enucleation of the lesion. Histological study of the resected specimen yielded a gastric schwannoma.  "
"An 82-year-old patient, diagnosed after a study of normocytic-normochromic anaemia by colonoscopy of neoplasia of the right colon. Both the histological and cytological studies diagnosed MM. After an exhaustive extension study, which included a thoracoabdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, dermatological examination (including exeresis and study of two nevi that ruled out MM), fundus study and anorectal examination, the patient underwent surgery and a right hemicolectomy. The anatomopathological study of the resection specimen confirmed the presence of a polypoid and ulcerated MM measuring 11 cm in diameter at the level of the ascending colon, which invaded the submucosa and focally the muscular layer. Numerous tumour cells contained melanin and immunohistochemistry was positive for S-100 protein and HMB45. Of the 30 lymph nodes resected, 2 had metastases. The patient followed a good postoperative course, being alive with no evidence of disease 4, 5 years after surgery.   "
"This is a 35-year-old woman, with a family history of Crohn's disease and no pathological history of interest or toxic habits, who started with abdominal pain in FID plus weight loss. She was studied on an outpatient basis and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease with ileal and ileocaecal valve involvement (A1L1B2, Vienna 1998), according to clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria. Treatment with mesalazine and steroids was started with good response. Due to corticodependence, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient remained steroid-free and in complete clinical remission, but symptomatology returned two years later. Infliximab was indicated and two doses were administered. Antinuclear antibodies, chest X-ray and viral serology were negative. Two weeks later, the patient was admitted with a fever of 39°C, pain and difficulty in moving the neck. The previous week he had presented with general malaise and fever, and had been treated for three days with azithromycin on an outpatient basis. Physical examination revealed thinness (BMI 17), temperature 37 ºC, blood pressure 105/60, she was conscious and oriented, with complete normal neurological examination, oral thrush and normal cardiorespiratory and abdominal examination. Tests showed normocytic anaemia (9.9 g/dl Hb), leukocytes 6,700 with 84% segmented, platelets 363,000. Blood biochemical parameters were normal except for GOT 87, GPT 51, gamma-GT 67 and total proteins were 5.8 g/dl with albumin 1,400 mg/dl. Urinalysis and sediment were normal, as were chest and abdominal X-rays on admission. A lumbar puncture was performed, detecting normal glycorrhachia, proteinorrachia of 102 mg/dl, 960 cells/mm3 , 90% of which corresponded to polynuclear cells, Gram stain in which no germs were observed and positive culture for Listeria monocytogenes, leading to the diagnosis of Listeria meningitis, initiating antibiotic treatment and suspending all immunosuppressive medication. Five days after hospitalisation, the patient presented with acute abdominal symptoms, with intestinal peritonitis secondary to perforation of the preterminal ileum and ileal stenosis, with the rest of the small intestine and colon remaining normal. Ileocecal resection and terminal ileostomy with mucosal fistula of the ascending colon were performed. Pathological anatomical pathology confirmed granulomatous inflammation compatible with Crohn's disease. The evolution was favourable, completing antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin for three weeks, with negative CSF at discharge. Azathioprine was reinstituted once stable and the infectious condition was overcome, and she was discharged 21 days after admission.   "
"A 52-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus infection, genotype 1b, with a high viral load (> 5 E5 IU/ml) came to the clinic complaining of asthenia and the appearance of skin lesions on the chest and face that bled, which spontaneously disappeared after compression. Physical examination revealed slight splenomegaly and the presence of spiders in the nasal region and chest. Laboratory tests showed GOT 108 U/l, GPT 113 U/l, GGT 131 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 116 U/l, total bilirubin 2.3 mg/dl, albumin 3.5 g/dl, prothrombin activity 75%, leukocytes 6,890, haemoglobin 10 g/dl, platelets 132,000, Ig G 1970, Ig M 162, ANA 1/40. Abdominal ultrasound: heteroechoic liver, irregular surface with hypertrophy of the caudate lobe. Permeable portal 10 mm. Spleen 14 cm. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: no oesophageal or gastric varices; no signs of portal hypertension gastropathy. Treatment was started with combination therapy with PegINF alfa 2a 180 mg/weekly sc. and ribavirin 1,000 mg/day, discontinued after 12 weeks due to lack of response. During follow-up, the patient reported worsening asthenia and dyspnoea on moderate exertion. Suspicion of hepatopulmonary syndrome led to arterial blood gases and spirometry: FEV1 105.9%, FVC 101.8%, FEV1/FVC 87.52 and a sonicated contrast echocardiogram which showed the passage of serum from the right atrium to the left suggesting cardiac shunt. These findings established the diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome (4). The patient presented with new episodes of bleeding from spider veins located in the thorax that did not respond to cauterisation, requiring surgical excision on two occasions. Treatment was started with tamoxifen, which reduced the bleeding episodes, and three weeks after starting treatment there were no new bleeding episodes and the number of lesions had stabilised.   "
"A 26-year-old woman diagnosed at 18 years of age with ulcerative colitis without requiring treatment. In October 2002 she presented new episodes of diarrhoea of 3-4 stools/day with red blood. Anamnesis by apparatus with no notable alterations. Rectal examination revealed an excrescent lesion 3-5 cm from the anal margin. HIV, lues, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus serology were negative. Several colonoscopies were performed which revealed a rectal formation 2-3 cm from the anus with an ulcerated surface (anatomopathological report of an ulcerated lesion with signs of dysplasia in the epithelium covered by fibrinous-leukocytic material, inconclusive) and treatment was therefore instituted with dietary hygiene measures, corticosteroid enemas and even 5-ASA suppositories. A new colonoscopy revealed a mixed hyperplastic polyp-tubular adenoma of the rectum and the patient was referred for surgery, which was carried out in January 2004 with transanal resection of the lesion and the anatomopathological report of chronic non-specific inflammation. After re-analysing the patient's history, given the discordance between the clinical and histological features of the lesion and its evolution over time, it was decided to review all the biopsy specimens by the same anatomopathologist, who found no evidence of villous adenoma or inflammatory bowel disease in any of the samples, and together with him, a diagnosis of ""cap polyposis"" was made.   "
"A 42-year-old woman with a personal history of umbilical hernia surgery and hypertension. She presented with pain in the FII of 2 years' evolution, rectal tenesmus and flat stools. Physical examination revealed diffuse pain on deep palpation in the FII. Blood tests showed 16,000 leukocytes and 91% neutrophils. A barium enema and colonoscopy were performed, both of which revealed a stenosing image at the level of the sigma. Histological study of the biopsies was inconclusive. Resection of the stenosis area with end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The histological study confirmed the lesion of endometriosis of the colon with transmural involvement causing areas of fibrosis and haemorrhage.   "
"A 30-year-old woman with no personal history of interest was admitted to our department with a diagnosis of obstructive jaundice secondary to possible choledocholithiasis. Laboratory tests showed bilirubin of 4.6 mg/dl, GOT 406 UI/l, GPT 512 UI/l, amylase 50 UI/l. Abdominal ultrasound: cholelithiasis. Bile duct not dilated. ERCP showed a dilated duct without choledocholithiasis and sphincterotomy was performed. After the test, the patient began with pain in the epigastrium and CDH radiating to the shoulder and a feeling of nausea. On examination, the patient was agitated, hypotensive, tachypnoeic with intense pain in the CDH with significant voluntary defence that made examination difficult. Laboratory tests: bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl, GOT 101 IU/l, GPT 311 IU/l, amylase 71 IU/l, haemoglobin 11.6 g/dl, leucocytes 8,800 µ/l. Abdominopelvic CT scan: collection of 4.7 x 10 x 11 cm with a denser area inside (probably clots and gas bubbles, suggestive of infection) adjacent to the right hepatic lobe. Aerobic in extrahepatic bile duct. No free fluid or pneumoperitoneum.  Based on the poor clinical condition of the patient, who did not respond to any analgesic regimen and the CT findings suggestive of abscess adjacent to the liver with signs of bleeding and infection, and without being able to rule out duodenal perforation, it was decided to perform surgery. During surgery, a subcapsular haematoma was observed in the right hepatic lobe measuring about 10 cm with bubbles inside. Intraoperative cholangiography was performed in which no alteration in the biliary tract was visualised, as well as cholecystectomy and evacuation of the abscess, leaving a drain in the right subphrenic space. The patient was taken to the ward and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started. Liquid culture: E. coli. Sterile blood cultures. Following an episode of anaemia, 4 red blood cell concentrates were transfused. Ultrasound scans and serial scans showed persistent haematoma, so it was decided to place a pig-tail. The evolution was satisfactory and she was discharged after 4 weeks of hospitalisation.   "
"CJRM. Male, 29 years old. Middle child of three brothers (the other two are healthy). Married with no children. Non-drinker and non-smoker. Repeated tonsillitis in childhood, being operated on at the age of 6. Asymptomatic. Normal bowel habits. Normal laboratory tests with slight persistent elevation of transaminases. Positive TTG (2.46). DQ2 (-) and DQ8 (+). Duodenal biopsy showed moderate atrophy of the intestinal villi, accompanied by a significant inflammatory infiltrate at the level of the lamina propria (Marsh stage 3b). He has been on GFD for 2 years, with good clinical and analytical response.  "
"65-year-old man, with no previous history of interest, polytraumatised after a car accident. He was intubated at the scene due to severe hypoxaemia and transferred to the critical care unit where, after assessment, a fracture of the left zygoma, lateral wall of the right orbit, fracture of his own bones, fracture of the left clavicle, fracture of the sternum, multiple bilateral costal fractures with left costal volet, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum without pneumothorax and fracture of the right pubic ramus. Due to the severe hypoxaemia during mechanical ventilation and the radiological findings, fibrobronchoscopy was performed 72 hours after admission, finding small ulcer-like lesions between the tracheal cartilages, and the orotracheal tube was removed up to the epiglottis for better tracheal visualisation, without observing other alterations. Eighteen days after admission, percutaneous tracheostomy was performed under endoscopic control, placing an 8 mm diameter cannula. Two weeks later, the patient was in a respiratory weaning situation and the tracheostomy cannula was changed. Forty-eight hours after this manoeuvre, the patient presented a new respiratory deterioration with the discovery of air in the enteral nutrition collection bag. A tracheoesophageal fistula was suspected, which was confirmed endoscopically, and the defect was corrected via the oesophageal route with a coated metal prosthesis together with a percutaneous gastrostomy for feeding. The patient died 7 days after cannula replacement due to catecholamine-resistant shock with extreme acidosis and hypoxaemia.   "
"A 24-year-old man with progressive abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa, of 24 hours' evolution, fever, loss of appetite and nausea without vomiting. His pathological history included colic atresia of the descending colon and small intestinal volvulus in the neonatal period, and he underwent intestinal devolvulation and double abduction of the colon to the abdominal wall (colostomy and mucosal fistula). At the age of 1.5 years, the release of both colic ends and end-to-end anastomosis were performed, as well as a prophylactic appendectomy. In the emergency room the patient was febrile (37.4°C). Physical examination revealed abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant with signs of peritoneal irritation. The CBC showed a leukocytosis of 19,100/mm3 with a left shift. Abdominal CT scan showed signs of probable appendicitis of the appendiceal stump: thickening of a tubular structure at the base of the cecum, some adjacent air bubbles and an appendicolith. A Mc Burney incision identified a pericecal plastron over a 1 cm appendicular stump with signs of gangrenous appendicitis; resection of the appendicular remnant, double suture in a tobacco pouch and washings were performed. He was treated with antibiotherapy -ertapenem- and discharged on the fourth day without complications.   "
"We refer the case of a 73-year-old female patient who consulted for jaundice and constitutional syndrome of less than 2 months' duration. In the emergency department there was evidence of a large painful hepatomegaly and analytical tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and mixed alteration of the liver profile, predominantly cholestatic (alkaline phosphatase and GGT more than 10 times the normal value and ALT and AST less than 3 times the normal value), without hepatic insufficiency.  Twenty-four hours after admission, he began with confusional symptoms that rapidly progressed to coma and fever of over 39ºC. An abdominal ultrasound and CT scan were performed, showing multiple space-occupying, hypodense, solid liver lesions distributed in both lobes and occupying practically the entire organ, suggestive of MTS. No infectious focus was found, several blood cultures were sterile and, by CT, the presence of brain lesions had been ruled out.  Analytically, the liver profile deteriorated, presenting a significant elevation of transaminases in the range of acute hepatitis (ALT and AST greater than 20 times the normal value with a significant increase in LDH) and signs of liver failure with progressive deterioration of renal function. Despite intensive treatment with anti-encephalopathy measures, vasoactive drugs, broad-spectrum antibiotics at high doses (to cover the CNS as a possible focus) and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, the patient died 5 days after admission as a result of multi-organ failure, without establishing the nature of the liver lesions or their origin due to the rapid evolution. For this reason, a clinical autopsy was performed. The necropsy confirmed the existence of extensive hepatic MTS. The primary tumour was a caecal adenocarcinoma 3 x 2 cm in diameter, Dukes stage D and Astler-Coller stage IV. It had serous and perivascular fatty infiltration and lymphatic and venular infiltration. MTS in locoregional infradiaphragmatic lymph nodes and lung parenchyma. In addition, lesions of associated ischaemic hepatitis and cholangiolitis and extensive pancreatic and peripancreatic autolysis were observed.   "
"This is a 72-year-old male patient with a personal history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia under pharmacological treatment, with no family history of interest or previous surgery. He was referred by his primary care physician for a three-week history of general malaise, a feeling of dizziness and dull pain in the right hypochondrium. There were no recent alterations in intestinal transit, rectorrhagia or melaenic stools. Physical examination revealed only a mildly painful abdominal palpation in the right hypochondrium, with no visceromegaly. Laboratory tests showed: leukocytes: 14.3 x 109/L (85% neutrophils); haemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL (MCV: 89.7 fL, MCH: 29.2 pg); LDH: 203 U/L; GOT: 71 U/L; GPT: 104 U/L; GGT: 311 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 526 U/L; total bilirubin: 0.74 mg/dL. Serologies for hepatotropic viruses, Brucella and Echinococcus, as well as serial blood cultures and determination of tumour markers, were negative or within normal ranges. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a space-occupying lesion in the right hepatic lobe (8.5 x 6.8 cm), polylobulated, with cystic-like areas inside. Abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) with contrast confirmed this image, which showed hypodense areas with peripheral enhancement, being overall highly suggestive of liver abscess. Fine-needle aspiration obtained abundant purulent material, the cytological analysis of which was congruent with acute inflammation of a non-specific nature, with no evidence of malignancy. Microbiological culture and parasite examination of the aspirate were negative. After the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone, metronidazole and gentamicin) and the implantation of percutaneous drainage, a favourable clinical evolution was obtained, with practical remission of the lesion in a subsequent radiological control. In order to investigate possible underlying pathogenic conditions, a colonoscopy was performed, which identified an exophytic lesion close to the ileocaecal valve, suspicious for malignancy; the anatomopathological study confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the cecum. The extension study did not reveal metastatic dissemination or other lesions in the liver, and a right hemicolectomy was performed with subsequent administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (capecitabine). The patient remains free of disease after 14 months of follow-up.   "
"33-year-old woman referred for abdominal pain. Allergic to penicillin, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, she had a normal pregnancy with normal delivery 4 years ago, and reported no toxic habits or regular medication. She came to the emergency department with pain in the left hypochondrium for 3 months, intensified in the last 24 hours. She also presented with increased abdominal perimeter, nausea and fever of 38.5 ºC, with no other infectious focality. No toxic syndrome or altered bowel habits were reported. On examination, she was conscious, oriented, normohydrated, with some pallor of the skin and mucous membranes. BP 140/80, HR 100 bpm, RR 20 rpm, axillary temperature 37.3 ºC. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation normal. The abdomen is soft, depressible, with the only finding being a hard, painful splenomegaly of about 17 cm. No peripheral lymph nodes were palpable and the extremities were normal. Laboratory tests on admission showed 2,900 leukocytes/mm3 (82% N, 14% L), HB 8.2 g%, HtH 26%, MCV 84.8, RDW 17.1, 79,000 plaq/mm3, quick 66%, cephalin 29; other biochemistry parameters were strictly normal (glycaemia, renal function and ionogram). Radiologically, there was elevation of the two haemidiaphragms without alteration of the pulmonary hilarity, and displacement of the intestinal loops due to a mass effect in the left hypochondrium. With a diagnosis of splenomegaly and pancytopenia, she was admitted to haematology. Abdominal ultrasound showed images compatible with multiple intraparenchymal splenic haematomas. The thoracoabdominal CT scan showed no other findings. Cytogenetic studies were negative, viral hepatic serology negative, mantoux negative, normal hormonal study, normal folic acid metabolites, complete coagulation study with no other findings than thrombopenia, normal haptoglobin, negative erythrocyte polyspecific direct coombs, proteinogram with slightly increased gamma globulin (22.4%; normal < 18.6%) and slightly decreased iron, 25 microg% (normal < 37). Tumour markers were negative, as well as screening for occult tumours (mammography, colonoscopy, genital cytology, bone marrow biopsy). During this study, she required the transfusion of 450 cc of de-leukocyte red blood cell concentrate, and remained haemodynamically stable, with abdominal pain controlled with first-stage analgesics. With the diagnosis of hypersplenism syndrome, a splenectomy was requested, which was performed laparoscopically without incident. The postoperative period was afebrile, without local or general complications, afebrile, pain remission, recovery of oral intake and removal of the drain. The anatomopathological report of the specimen showed: splenic peliosis without endothelial hyperplasia, with sinus histiocytosis and macrophagic cells and haemosiderin crystals. After one year of follow-up, the woman has recovered the normal parameters of the three haematological series without any treatment, with no evidence of complications or hepatic recurrence.   "
"A 68-year-old woman, with a personal history of interest, reported smoking 20 cigarettes/day for the last 40 years, and as surgical interventions: cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy and bilateral adnexectomy (due to uterine polymyomatosis). Two years earlier, she was seen at a gastrointestinal clinic for moderate to solid dysphagia, with no other accompanying symptoms. An upper endoscopy was performed and a hiatal hernia was found, and treatment with proton pump inhibitors was recommended, with considerable improvement in symptoms. Subsequently, during the consultation period, the patient presented with severe epigastric pain of several months' duration, and a second endoscopy was repeated, revealing a lesion in the middle third of the oesophagus, biopsied and reported as an ulcerated and infiltrating small cell carcinoma of the oat-cell type. In view of these findings, the patient underwent further studies and different explorations with the fundamental objective of finding the primary tumour (thinking of a pulmonary origin given the histological species of the neoplasm) and staging the disease. On examination, the patient was in good general condition, afebrile, with no findings of adenopathies or relevant data on cardiopulmonary auscultation, with a normal abdomen except for the right subcostal and infraumbilical scar and no neurological alterations. Laboratory tests showed no relevant alterations. The barium oesophagogastroduodenal study showed a flat, ulcerated lesion 5 cm from the oesophagogastric junction, about 5 cm long, which discreetly reduced the lumen of the esophagogastric junction, the rest of the study being normal.  The thoraco-abdominal CT scan showed a neoplasm in the middle third of the oesophagus, causing a reduction in its lumen, with lymphadenopathy in the subcarinal area, left supraclavicular (1.5 cm); in the abdomen, lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum, retrocrural area and right iliac chain; images suggestive of bilobular liver metastases and a large splenic cyst. There was no evidence of a space-occupying lesion in the lung. Fibrobronchoscopy revealed no pathological findings. A transthoracic puncture aspirate was positive for oat-cell carcinoma, which could indicate pleural invasion.  Echoendoscopy showed a vegetating and ulcerated oesophageal tumour, extending from 30 to 35 cm and infiltrating 2/3 of its sides, but allowing passage of the endoscope. Between 28 and 32 cm there was a well-demarcated retrocardiac extrinsic mass which did not infiltrate the oesophagus. Multiple celiac adenopathies were found. And biopsy of the lesion is reported as small cell oat-cell carcinoma. Cranial CT did not demonstrate any pathological findings. Given the extent of the neoplasm, surgery was ruled out and chemotherapy was considered as the main therapeutic option. At the end of this study, the patient was being treated in the Oncology Unit of our hospital (CDDP plus etoposide).   "
"A 60-year-old male patient with a history of several episodes of acute pancreatitis of enolic origin. He presented with fever, general malaise, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting of food. He was admitted to the Emergency Department where haemodynamic instability was observed with sinus tachycardia at 130x' and arterial hypotension (BP: 80/50 mmHg), for which reason he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Physical examination on arrival at the ICU revealed a large abdominal distension, with a diffuse painful abdomen and palpation of a mass at the epigastric level extending towards the left hypochondrium. Blood tests showed leukocytosis with significant left shift, hyperglycaemia, and a discrete elevation of both bilirubin and liver enzymes. After stabilisation, an abdominal CT scan showed a pancreatic pseudocyst measuring 17 x 8 centimetres in diameter that displaced the intestinal loops and compressed the stomach.  Transgastric drainage was attempted by means of endoscopic ultrasound but was not possible as the compression exerted by the mass made it impossible for the endoscope to progress. Several percutaneous drainage attempts were also made, all of which were unsuccessful. For this reason, it was decided to perform a surgical evacuation by marsupialisation of the pseudocyst by means of cystogastrostomy, obtaining a total of 4 litres of purulent material. Subsequent evolution was satisfactory and he was discharged from the ICU 6 days after admission.   "
"A 37-year-old man, with no medical history of interest, came to the emergency department under police custody from the airport due to suspicion of ingestion and intra-abdominal transport of drug wrappers (BP). During a scheduled flight, the patient had a convulsive episode and subsequently expelled three foreign bodies orally. On arrival, the patient presented: blood pressure 157/88 mmHg, heart rate 108 bpm, temperature 37°C and O2 saturation 94%. On examination, the abdomen was distended and matt to percussion, non-painful, with palpation of multiple foreign bodies in the mesogastrium and no peritonism. Neurological examination showed slightly mydriatic pupils, Glasgow 15 and no neurological focality. Abdominal radiography confirmed the presence of multiple intra-abdominal radio-opaque foreign bodies. The most relevant analytical findings were: leucocytes 14.1 x 109/l (neutrophils: 86%), creatinine 1.7 mg/dl and glucose 131 mg/dl. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Urinalysis was positive for cocaine and its metabolites and benzodiazepines. Evacuation treatment with polyethylene glycol solution (Casenglicol®) and strict clinical observation was started. Two hours after admission, the patient experienced an episode of psychomotor agitation and tachycardia (120 beats/min), followed by a decreased level of consciousness, motor incoordination, mydriasis and tonic-clonic crisis, and was transferred to an intensive care unit. Clonazepam (1 mg) and diazepam (10 mg) e.v. were administered and it was decided to perform an emergency laparotomy. After accessing the abdominal cavity, multiple hard foreign bodies were palpated along the entire digestive tract. A transverse gastrotomy at the antral level, a longitudinal ileotomy 15 cm from the ileocaecal valve and two longitudinal colotomies (at the level of the transverse colon and sigma) were performed, with removal of multiple foreign bodies. An anterograde lavage of the rectum-sigma was performed with physiological saline solution through a colotomy, and another four packets were evacuated distal to the promontory. A total of 96 cylindrical foreign bodies of 5 cm in length with multilayer latex wrapping, smooth, compact and of apparently resistant manufacture were extracted. None of the packages showed visible signs of breakage. The patient was observed for 24 hours in an intensive care unit. Peristalsis and oral diet were started on the second postoperative day. The patient progressed well and was discharged from hospital on the fourth postoperative day.   "
"80-year-old woman with AHT, CKD and hypothyroidism. Admitted to the geriatric ward for cognitive deterioration, she developed an acute abdomen with septic shock. An abdominal CT scan showed free fluid and thickening of the colonic wall. She underwent total colectomy with terminal ileostomy due to ischaemic colitis and splenectomy due to intraoperative bleeding. Postoperative evolution was favourable with resolution of shock. He tolerated enteral nutrition (EN), the ileostomy functioning well. On the 8th postoperative day, given the appearance of abdominal haematic drainage, a CT scan was performed, revealing haematoma of the surgical site. Subsequently, the drainage had a milky appearance, with a debit greater than 1,000 cc/d. On analysis: TG 166 mg/dL (blood TG 42, albumin 1.8), glucose 100 mg/dL, protein 0.83 g/dL, amylase 133, cells 145 (PMN 65%, M 32%), negative bacteriological culture, confirming the presence of FL.  TPN and somatostatin 3 mg/12 h i.v. were started. Drainage debit decreased progressively (BQ: TG 3 mg/dl, proteins 2.2 g/dl), subsiding after 5 days. Lymphoscintigraphy was therefore not deemed necessary. Low-fat, medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA)-rich, hyperproteic EN was added, with good tolerance.   "
"A 40-year-old patient attended the outpatient department of the Digestive Service for a study of elevated transaminases in a routine blood test. In the abdominal ultrasound study, a LOE was detected in segments 2 and 3 of the liver with a maximum size of 4 cm, with solid characteristics compatible with the diagnosis of hepatoma. The abdominal multislice computed axial tomography (CT) scan showed a focal lesion with lobulated borders measuring 4 cm in diameter in segments 2 and 3, with intense enhancement after injection of intravenous contrast in the arterial phase; and with washout in the portal phase, findings compatible with the diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma. There was no evidence of other focal lesions. The intrahepatic bile duct was not dilated and the gallbladder showed no lithiasic images.  Fine needle aspiration puncture (FNA) of the lesion was performed under ultrasound control with negative results for malignant cells and with a positive CD 34 in the immunohistochemical study.  Systematic blood tests were normal, as were liver function, immunoglobulins, antibodies and tumour markers. Viral markers were also negative. Given the diagnosis of probable hepatoma on non-cirrhotic liver, surgical resection was decided. Segments 2 and 3 were resected laparoscopically, using two No. 12 ports, periumbilical and in the right hypochondrium, and a gel port in the left hypochondrium. The intraoperative histological study diagnosed hepatocellular proliferation with no histological signs of malignancy, the lesion being 2 cm from the edge of the surgical resection. In the anatomopathological study, the nodular formation showed liver tissue with a compact trabecular pattern of up to 3 cell layers, with proliferation of the large muscular arteries surrounded by a dense connective stroma, where no preserved portal spaces were identified. The pathological diagnosis was focal nodular hyperplasia. The postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.   "
"A 16-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy treatment for recurrent Hodgkin's disease. During the course of this treatment, the patient showed signs of digestive haemorrhage (melenas), accompanied by an intense elevation of transaminases and a significant alteration in blood coagulation tests (protombin activity). The patient died a few days later due to acute liver failure, with signs of encephalopathy and massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage. At necropsy, diffuse liver damage was observed, accompanied by focal lesions in the lower third of the oesophagus. The histological study showed, in both organs, an inflammatory lesion of necrotising character, showing cytopathic changes typical of herpetic infection, consisting of images of multinucleation and presence of Cowdry type A bodies.   "
"A 65-year-old male patient, smoker of 20-40 cigarettes/day and with a history of duodenal ulcus. He had undergone surgery 5 years previously for stenosing neoplasia of the rectosigmoid junction (Dukes stage B adenocarcinoma, T3N0M0, stage III-A AJCC), and underwent anterior resection followed by end-to-end anastomosis by mechanical suture using the double stapling technique. The postoperative course of the operation was uneventful and the patient was followed up in consultation every 6 months, with colonoscopy and ultrasound being performed annually. The endoscopic image of the perianastomotic region was normal in all revisions, including the last one performed the previous year (4 years after the operation). Five years after the operation, the patient began to have soft stools, intermittent abdominal pain in the hypogastrium and later rectorrhagia. He was admitted to the internal medicine department and underwent an abdominal CT scan, which revealed no pathological findings, and colonoscopy, which revealed a stricture 10 cm from the anal margin that prevented the passage of the endoscope. A biopsy was performed which showed no histopathological signs of malignant disease and was reported as a non-specific ulcer.  Given that serum tumour markers were at normal levels, and in the absence of other signs of neoplasia, it was decided to repeat the endoscopy and perform an opaque enema. The new endoscopy and biopsy showed identical findings to the previous ones. The barium enema showed a colon stenosis of irregular appearance and 8 cm in length, and the possibility of malignant stenosis could not be ruled out with this image. In the absence of conclusive evidence of tumour recurrence, a period of treatment with corticosteroid enemas (budesonide, 2 mg enema, twice a day) was decided upon in order to reduce inflammation and thus complete the endoscopic examination.  After a month, with the patient asymptomatic, the endoscopy was repeated, finding an inflammatory and ulcerated mucosa, covering a 6-8 cm long stricture that could be passed through with the endoscope, with no signs of neoplasia and the rest of the colon appearing normal. The biopsies taken showed non-specific inflammatory signs. The stricture was judged to be of ischaemic origin and, given that the patient was totally asymptomatic, periodic follow-up was decided. After 6 months of follow-up, electrocardiographic alterations were detected, for which the cardiologist was consulted. Ergometry and coronary angiography revealed irregularities in the middle proximal anterior descending artery, severe involvement of the ostium of the diagonal branch, 80% stenosis of the obtuse marginal branch and 80% stenosis in the middle right coronary artery. Dilatation and implantation of a double coronary stent was decided, after which the electrocardiographic alterations disappeared. After 16 months of follow-up, the patient has normal transit and is asymptomatic.   "
"We present the case of a 30-year-old male from sub-Saharan Africa with a history of angiodema, no previous surgery and no chronic treatments. He consulted for diarrhoea with mucus and blood for several weeks. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly and non-painful hepatomegaly. The haemogram showed a haemoglobin of 10.3 g, 53,000 platelets, 3,460 leukocytes, with a normal formula. Liver function showed elevated liver enzymes (GOT 48, GPT 63) and prothrombin activity 53%. On immunochemistry, total IgE was 960 mg (VN < 100). Peripheral blood smear showed moderate anisocytosis with polysegmentation of neutrophils, with no atypical cells. Serology for hepatotropic viruses, HIV, Toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, Salmonella, Brucella, hydatidosis, leishmaniasis, fascioliasis and amoebiasis was negative, with the exception of serology for Schistosoma which was positive at a titre of 1/512 (IgG). Stool and urine cultures and stool parasites were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed indirect signs of chronic liver disease and a homogeneous splenomegaly of 16 cm, with varicose veins in the splenic hilum. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed grade II/IV varicose veins in the oesophagus and very congestive gastric mucosa in the stomach, especially in the antrum and gastric body, and pseudotumoral varicose veins in the gastric cardia. A colonoscopy was performed, revealing a petechial rectitis with a small polyp measuring 0.6 cm, which was removed. Pathological examination of the rectal biopsies revealed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with focal abscess formation and a moderate presence of eosinophils, with no noticeable depletion of goblet cells. After multiple sections of the polypoid formation, oval structures of refractive cuticle measuring 150 microns in maximum diameter with massive internal calcification were observed in the submucosa.  With the diagnosis of schistosomiasis with rectal and hepatic involvement, treatment was started with praziquantel at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight in three doses. The patient improved clinically and analytically, with normalisation of liver function parameters and haemogram. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound six months after treatment showed the disappearance of the oesophagogastric varices and the ultrasound signs of chronic liver disease.   "
"Female patient, aged 26 years, diagnosed with coeliac disease with anti-transglutaminase antibodies 73 U (normal value up to 10) and duodenal biopsy with enteropathy with severe villous atrophy (grade III). She progressed well on a gluten-free diet, with diarrhoea disappearing and nutritional status improving. Six months later the patient became pregnant, presenting foetal death at 36 weeks. The following year she became pregnant again. Anticardiolipin IgG antibodies were determined: 20 GPL U/ml (v.n. < 11) and anticardiolipin IgM: 9 MPL U/ml (v.n. < 10). The haematological study showed no other prothrombotic alterations. She was medicated with acetylsalicylic acid at a dose of 200 mg/day, presenting normal pregnancy and birth by caesarean section.   "
"Female patient, aged 38 years, diagnosed with coeliac disease with anti-transglutaminase antibodies 46 U (v.n. up to 5) and duodenal biopsy compatible with coeliac disease. She subsequently had two spontaneous miscarriages and a cerebral transient ischaemic attack. Currently in the sixth month of pregnancy with anticardiolipin antibodies IgM 75 MPL/ml (v.n. up to 20) and anticardiolipin IgG in normal values. Haematological study showed no other prothrombotic alterations. She continues treatment with subcutaneous heparin and a gluten-free diet.   "
"A 79-year-old man who, after scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy converted due to anatomical difficulties, presented on the first postoperative day with an external biliary fistula due to environmental drainage. In the imaging tests performed, some of which were repeated twice (ultrasound, CT, CT with pigtail drainage of the biloma, cRMN, diagnostic ERCP and subsequent ERCP with placement of a 7 cm 10 F biliary stent), the cause of the persistent biliary fistula could not be demonstrated, presenting the integrity of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tract, with anatomical and functional characteristics of normal appearance. The debit of the external biliary fistula, however, ranged between 200 and 400 cc. daily. Laboratory tests showed an alanine aminotransferase of 109 U/l (7-40 U/l); aspartate aminotransferase of 98 U/l (7-40 U/l); GGT of 120 U/l (7-40 U/l); alkaline phosphatase of 262 U/l (7-40 U/l); total bilirubin of 1.8 mg/dl (0.2-1.3 mg/dl). Despite the internal biliary drainage of the main bile duct, the persistence of the external biliary fistula led to the suspicion of an aberrant duct, so it was decided to operate 45 days after the initial cholecystectomy, requesting our intraoperative collaboration due to the difficulties encountered in the identification and interpretation of the findings of the operative field in the biliary hilum. Only intraoperatively did cholangiography through the mouthpiece of the juxtahilar biliary fistula show that the lesion originated in an aberrant duct of the independent right anterior sector (segments V-VIII), without any relation to the rest of the intrahepatic biliary tree, confirming the diagnostic suspicion and making it possible to treat the lesion by means of a Roux-en-Y loop cholangiojejunostomy with transanastomotic guidance by means of a siliconised paediatric feeding catheter. On the 7th postoperative day a transcatheter cholangiography was performed with absolute normality of the anastomosis and absence of leaks, and the patient was discharged. The transanastomotic tutor was removed one month after surgery after a second cholangiographic control, demonstrating the total integrity and functionality of the anastomosis. In the annual controls the patient maintains a total normality of the analytical tests.   "
"A 33-year-old man with no history of interest and no known family history of thrombosis came to the emergency department for intermittent diffuse abdominal pain of several days' evolution with nausea and some alimentary vomiting. Physical examination revealed diffuse pain on abdominal palpation with no signs of peritoneal irritation. The most relevant analytical data were: glucose 84 mg/dl, urea 30 mg/dl, creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, amylase 29 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase 241 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase 26 U/l, total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 4.1 mg/dl, haemoglobin 14.4 mg/dl, platelets 301. 000 mm3, leukocytes 6,700 mm3, prothrombin activity 85%, fibrinogen 518 mg/dl and D-dimer 5,871 ng/ml. An abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged portal vein (1.6 cm in diameter), with no flow within it on Doppler study. An abdominal CT scan showed thrombosis of the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein, with no other alterations. The patient was treated with enoxaparin (1 mg/kg every 12 hours) for 10 days, with a favourable evolution, and then continued treatment with acenocoumarol. The thrombophilia study identified heterozygosity for the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene, with factor V Leiden, activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies, proteins C and S, antithrombin and plasma homocysteine being normal or negative. An MRI angiogram performed 10 months later showed a 15 cm splenomegaly and an enlarged but patent portal vein with cavernomatous transformation (with small periportal collateral vessels). An oral gastrointestinal endoscopy performed 14 months after the initial picture was normal. After 15 months of follow-up treatment with acenocoumarol, the patient remains asymptomatic.   "
"A 76-year-old patient underwent emergency surgery for a perforated cecum tumour obstructing the terminal ileum. His personal history included ischaemic heart disease with an AMI and coronary artery bypass grafting 13 and 6 years ago respectively. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and resection of 15 cm of ileum with reconstruction of the transit by means of an ileocolic anastomosis. A liver metastasis was observed in segment 8 with a size of 4 cm. A second operation was required 4 days later due to intra-abdominal abscess. The anatomopathological study was of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with 17 lymph nodes free of tumour infiltration (T4N0M1). Postoperative CT scan showed a 3.5 cm solid nodular lesion in segment 8 of the liver. Postoperative MQ with FOLFOX was performed and the lesion decreased in size to 2.5 cm. Six months after the intervention of the primary tumour, it was decided to perform a laparoscopic RF of the liver metastasis, given the high surgical risk of the patient.  The procedure was performed under general anaesthesia with the patient in supine decubitus. The access trocar to the abdominal cavity and for the optic was placed at epigastric level. An 11 mm trocar was used and placed below the costal ridge. The portable 7.5 Mhz laparoscopic ultrasound transducer was placed through the 11 mm trocar. No other metastatic lesions were observed on intraoperative ultrasound. Under ultrasound and laparoscopic control, the electrode was inserted in the centre of the lesion and ablated with a target temperature of 105°C, a treatment time of 6 minutes, an achieved power of 150 W and a successful ablation of the intrahepatic path. The RF electrode used was 25 cm long and had an ablation diameter of 4 cm. The lesion became hyperechogenic after ablation and no residual lesion was observed. There were no postoperative complications and the hospital stay was one day. One month after RF treatment, a helical CT scan was performed, showing a hypodense lesion with absence of uptake, compatible with complete necrosis of the tumour lesion.   "
"A 68-year-old man, with no known drug allergies, with a history of hypertension, mild chronic renal failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, antithrombin III deficiency leading to intestinal ischaemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosis nine years earlier, with resection of 150 cm of jejunum and ileum. In March 2005, she came to the emergency department after presenting at home with two melenic stools. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, showing a depapillated mucosal portion of the duodenum with no active bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed multiple teleangiectatic lesions with no active bleeding. Subsequently, capsule endoscopic examination revealed multiple ecchymoses in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and cecum. After several similar episodes of HDB requiring transfusions, capsule and endoscopy were repeated, with no new findings. Scintigraphy with labelled red blood cells was also performed and was compatible with small bowel angiodysplasia. During one of the episodes, a mesenteric angiography was performed, showing extravasation at the level of the arteriovenous fistula and performing embolisation with coils, after which she presented with acute abdominal symptoms and persistent bleeding, performing a laparotomy and finding ischaemia of the previous anastomosis, possibly related to the embolisation. A new resection of the ileum was performed, leaving about 80 cm with the ileocaecal valve intact. Despite the intervention, the patient continued to suffer from HDB, and treatment with somatostatin was tried, but without response. In the 28 months following the first episode, the patient required a total of 132 red blood cell concentrates. Given the failure of all previous therapies and the lack of relevance of new surgical treatments, treatment with thalidomide at a dose of 100 mg per day was started at the beginning of July 2007. Eight months later, the patient has had no new episodes of HDB and has not required any transfusions. The patient is currently followed up monthly in outpatient clinics and is asymptomatic except for occasional mild paresthesia in the lower limbs, with a normal electromyogram. The patient has had one episode of bilateral PTE that resolved with anticoagulant treatment. Given the history of antithrombin III deficiency and the fact that thrombophilia is not described among the possible side effects of thalidomide, we believe that this event is not attributable to the use of thalidomide.   "
"66-year-old male, active smoker, with a history of partial gastrectomy for ulcer disease and chronic hepatopathy due to HCV under regular follow-up. He was admitted for digestive haemorrhage in the form of melaena accompanied by pain in the right hip of several weeks' evolution, radiating down the antero-lateral side of the thigh to the knee; he also reported constitutional syndrome with a weight loss of 6 kg. Physical examination revealed pain on palpation in the right femoral head and discrete hepatomegaly of 2 cm, while basic biochemical and haemocyte data were normal, except for discrete anaemia; serum levels of αFP were 4.4 ng/ml. Abdominal CT scan showed an 8 x 7 x 5 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe with heterogeneous contrast uptake, suggestive of HCC; conventional radiology of the pelvis and hip revealed a lytic image with a moth-eaten pattern at the level of the neck and right femoral head. Bone scintigraphy (99mTc) showed a pathological accumulation of radiotracer at this level, as well as in the left supraorbital region. Finally, the histological study by biopsy of the lesion in the femoral neck confirmed the diagnosis of HCC metastasis. Chemoembolisation of the primary tumour was performed, associated with palliative radiotherapy on the coxofemoral joint (total dose of 2,400 cGy), with evident symptomatic improvement. Six months later, the patient presented a pathological subtrochanteric fracture that required ostesynthesis using a PFN nail, and died 20 weeks after the intervention.   "
"This is a 27-year-old male patient, also a native of Senegal and with no previous history of interest, who consulted for vomiting and abdominal pain. The patient reported asthenia and anorexia of one month's duration, with diffuse abdominal discomfort from the onset. In view of the progression of the symptoms and the appearance of vomiting, he went to the emergency department. Physical examination showed an acceptable general state of health, with only a great pain on palpation in the epigastrium and right hypochondrium, with palpation of an area of impaction compatible with a mass at this level. There were no signs of peritoneal irritation, although there was voluntary defence. Laboratory tests showed moderate hypertransaminasemia and mild coagulopathy. Ultrasonography revealed the presence of a large hepatic mass (approximately 12 cm in diameter) with numerous satellite nodules. MRI confirmed the hypervascular nature of these lesions. Finally, viral serology revealed chronic HBV infection and the alpha-fetoprotein was 12,687 ng/ml, so the patient was diagnosed with giant HCC with satellites and HBV infection. Symptomatic palliative treatment was started and he died a few months later.   "
"A 36-year-old man consulted for chronic diarrhoea and weight loss. An analytical study was performed, consisting of general biochemistry, haemogram, TSH, immunological study, celiac profile and stool parasites, which was normal. C-reactive protein was elevated. Colonoscopy was performed up to the cecum, which was normal, and no abnormalities were identified in the barium intestinal transit. Abdominal ultrasound showed a left renal mass in the upper pole measuring more than 4 cm in diameter, rounded, isoechoic with hypoechoic areas inside that could be compatible with necrotic areas.  The CT scan confirmed the existence of this 4.3 cm lesion, hypodense, limited to the kidney, without affecting the perirenal fat or the vascular pedicle. The patient was referred to the urology department and underwent laparoscopic left nephrectomy, with macroscopic visualisation of a lobulation in one of its poles, with an intact Gerota's capsule and no other significant macroscopic alterations. In the sections, a rounded, well-defined lesion measuring 4.8 x 4.5 cm was identified at this pole, with yellowish, brownish parenchyma, with small millimetric cavities and friable to the cut, being very close to the renal capsule. A diagnosis of Delahunt and Eble type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma was made. The patient is currently asymptomatic, with the diarrhoeic symptoms for which he consulted having subsided after the operation.   "
"A 46-year-old male patient, diagnosed with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, mixed cellularity variety, stage IV-B with medullary, hepatic and splenic involvement, undergoing treatment with chemotherapy (escalated BEACOPP). In the induction phase of chemotherapy (day 11) he began with fever, chills and melena. Laboratory tests showed neutropenia (100 leukocytes/mm3) and platelets. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and during admission suffered lower gastrointestinal bleeding with hypovolemic shock, which required intubation and transfusion of blood products. Upper endoscopy identified a large ulceration in the proximal jejunum measuring 2-3 cm, with smooth edges and a necrotic background, with no active bleeding. The pathology study of the biopsy taken from the edges of the ulcer showed several fragments of small intestine mucosa, some ulcerated, with a dense mixed inflammatory infiltrate, with numerous foreign body giant cells, identifying abundant thick non-septate hyphae in their cytoplasm and among the infiltrate, compatible with mucormycosis. CT scan identified a thickening of the intestinal wall in jejunum, 4.5 cm in diameter, and multiple hypodense lesions in both hepatic lobes and lytic involvement in vertebral bodies at dorsal and lumbar level. Treatment was started with amphotericin B, with glycaemic control, and eradicatory surgery was considered. The patient underwent surgery, which revealed a plastron located in the jejunum with involvement of the transverse mesocolon, with double perforation covering the jejunum. The anatomopathological study of the jejunum and ileum resection specimen showed ulceration and intense acute and chronic inflammation with double perforation and adhesion of loops, secondary to infection by Zygomycetes of the mucor type, with extensive fibrinoid necrosis of the medium-sized vessels of the subserosal fat. The hyphae are thick, of variable diameter, branching at different angles and in coronal sections show a clear, reinforced membrane. The hyphae were PAS and methanamine silver positive for fungi. The patient had no complications from the surgery. At one year follow-up the patient is still alive and his lymphoma is in remission.   "
"Recently, we attended a 46-year-old man in our hospital, with a history of Down's syndrome and severe mental retardation, who came to the emergency department of our hospital presenting with diffuse abdominal pain and progressive abdominal distension of 24 hours' duration. He presented a history of constipation and absence of bowel movements in the last 2 days. As a background of interest, the patient had presented, 13 years earlier, with a gastric volvulus that was operated on urgently, and a surgical gastropexy was performed. During the operation, a dolichocolon was observed, with absence of fixation ligaments, but no procedure was performed on it. In the current physical examination, the only findings were abdominal distension and tympanism, accompanied by diffuse abdominal pain. Rectal examination failed to demonstrate stool in rectal ampulla. Haemogram and biochemistry were normal. Plain abdominal X-ray showed massive dilatation of the proximal colon. This distension could also be seen on computed tomography (CT). Subsequent barium enema demonstrated the typical ""bird's beak"" image. Although with difficulty, the barium passed into the dilated segment of the splenic angle. A therapeutic colonoscopy was performed, which succeeded in untwisting the colonic segment. The patient passed a large amount of stool and gas, remained asymptomatic after 24-48 hours, and was discharged from the hospital and referred to the surgical department. Two days later, his symptoms reappeared and he was diagnosed with recurrence of volvulus of the splenic flexure of the colon. The colonoscopy was repeated and the urgent process was again resolved. The patient underwent scheduled surgery and resection of the redundant segment of the colon was performed. The postoperative period was uneventful.   "
"A 41-year-old man diagnosed with a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma implanted on short segment Barrett's oesophagus, detected during routine endoscopy carried out in the context of a long-standing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The patient underwent surgery, with total transhiatal oesophagectomy with cervical anastomosis, creating a tubulised gastric conduit, associated with vagotomy, without pyloroplasty. Postoperatively, the patient presented with copious and persistent vomiting that did not improve after a week of conservative treatment, including metoclopramide and i.v. erythromycin. Oral endoscopy demonstrated abundant retention in the gastric conduit and a markedly stenosed pylorus. Pyloric dilatation with an 18 mm balloon (CRE™ Wireguided Balloon Dilator; Boston Scientific Corporation) was performed, followed by easy passage of a 10 mm gastroscope through the pyloric channel. However, after a few days, the patient did not experience any improvement. A barium study revealed an almost complete and persistent stop in the pylorus, allowing only a filiform passage of contrast.  One week after dilatation, a new pyloric dilatation, in this case forced, was performed with a 35 mm balloon (Rigiflex®; Microvasive, Boston Scientific, USA), with the patient's informed consent. The procedure was performed under deep sedation, with anaesthetist, endoscopic and fluoroscopic control. The endoscope was advanced into the descending duodenum, leaving a radio-opaque guide. The pylorus was marked by submucosal contrast injections at several points. With the endoscope withdrawn, the balloon was advanced over the guidewire until it was correctly positioned, under fluoroscopic control. At that point, the balloon was inflated with air at 300 mmHg, with manometric control, to 300 mmHg for two minutes. After the procedure, the pylorus was widely dilated. After dilatation, plain abdominal radiology was performed and the patient was monitored for signs and symptoms of perforation or bleeding. No complications occurred. The patient was able to drink fluids without problems after 24 hours. In the following days, progressive oral tolerance was satisfactory. A new radiological control with barium showed good passage of contrast into the duodenum. The patient was discharged a few days later and is asymptomatic 3 months later.   "
"We present a 38-year-old male patient with no past history of interest who came to the emergency department with syncopal symptoms accompanied by a melanic-rectorrhagic stool. Examination: conscious and oriented, BP 106/68 mmHg, abdomen soft and depressible, positive rectal examination for haematic debris. The blood test showed a CBC of 30%, then 23% and a urea level of 67 mg/dl. A gastroscopy was performed, which was normal, and a colonoscopy up to the cecum and terminal ileum showed incipient angiodysplastic lesions of the colon and rectum. A capsule endoscopy was requested, which showed no pathological findings, and subsequently a Tc99m-pertechnetate scan showed the existence of a focal hyperactive area in the right iliac fossa adjacent to the right iliac artery suggestive of the existence of ectopic gastric mucosa compatible with Meckel's diverticulum in that location. It was decided to operate under general anaesthesia with a Mc Burney incision, observing a Meckel's diverticulum 60 cm from the ileocaecal valve with a wide base (> 50% of the surface of the intestinal diameter) and inflammatory signs. Intestinal resection was performed, including the diverticulum and a mechanical latero-lateral anastomosis plus prophylactic appendectomy. The postoperative period was uneventful and he was discharged on the 5th day. No blood transfusion was required. The pathological anatomy reported Meckel's diverticulum with heterotopic gastric mucosa.   "
"We present the case of a 68-year-old asymptomatic male, with no history of interest, referred for study of a lesion at the level of the uncinate process of the pancreas. The lesion was detected incidentally by abdominal ultrasound performed for the study of low back pain.  The abdominal CT scan showed an inhomogeneous mass at the level of the uncinate process with an anteroposterior diameter of 3.6 cm, blurring of the peripancreatic fat and dilatation of the main pancreatic duct.  An examination was carried out with linear echoendoscopy equipment (PENTAX UX 3630) where invasion of the bile duct and adjacent structures was excluded. The cytological study of the material obtained by echoendoscopy-guided FNA was negative for malignancy. With the suspicion of adenocarcinoma, a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. Macroscopically, a well-demarcated greyish lesion measuring 1.8 cm x 1 cm with a soft consistency and a necrotic appearance in its centre was described with a histopathological diagnosis of a lymphoepithelial cyst.   "
"A 43-year-old man from Morocco was admitted to our department for 4 days of painless mucocutaneous jaundice, choluria and generalised pruritus. The only history of interest was a treated tuberculosis, hypercholesterolemia under dietary treatment and mild smoking. Laboratory tests showed the following: bilirubin 19.44 mg/dl, GOT 110 IU/ml, GPT 371 IU/ml, GGT 632 IU/ml, FA 787 IU/ml, LDH 394 IU/ml. Amylase and lipase were normal throughout. Hypergammaglobulinaemia (gamma globulin 1.56%) was also notable, with IgG 1840 IU/ml (751-1560 IU/ml). The CA 19-9 marker was 82 IU/ml. Autoantibodies (ANA, AMA, AMA-2, ANCA, LKM1, SMA, SLA and F-actin) and serologies for viruses and bacteria (HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HSV, parotidis virus, parvovirus B19, Brucella, Borrelia, Coxiella, Leishmania, Rickettsiae and Toxoplasma) were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed dilatation of the intra- and extrahepatic bile duct and echoendoscopy (EUS) showed an enlarged pancreas with a 3 cm focal lesion at the level of the head and mild posterior dilatation of the pancreatic duct. The thoracoabdominal CT scan also showed an overall enlarged pancreas, hypodense, with a hypodense peripancreatic halo, with a smooth border, without involvement of the peripancreatic fat, and, at the retroperitoneal level, in the periaortic location with extension to bilateral iliac territory, a dense tissue surrounding these vascular structures like a case, all of which was compatible with autoimmune pancreatitis with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Given the persistence of pruritus and manifest cholestasis, percutaneous biliary drainage was performed and the cholangiography showed a stenosing lesion in the distal common bile duct suggestive of pancreatic neoplasia. In view of this possibility, as a first differential diagnosis, a fine needle puncture-aspiration guided by EUS was performed with negative cytology for malignant cells and negative Zielh staining. Given the absence of confirmation of neoplasia, and with the suspicion of autoimmune pancreatitis, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed, observing dilatation of the main bile duct with a regular stenosis in its distal portion, of about 3-4 cm, of benign appearance, over which a plastic stent was placed. Treatment was started with corticosteroids (methylprednisolone at a dose of 32 mg/day) and the percutaneous drain was removed. With the diagnosis of probable PAI, the patient was discharged and followed up on an outpatient basis, with normalisation of all analytical parameters and resolution in the control abdominal CT scan, at one and four months, of the lesions described initially, with normalisation of the pancreatic size and appearance and disappearance of the retroperitoneal fibrosis. The dose of corticosteroids was progressively reduced until it was completely withdrawn at 4 months, and the biliary stent was also withdrawn. To date, after 24 months of follow-up, the patient has remained asymptomatic with no recurrence of autoimmune pancreatitis or retroperitoneal fibrosis.   "
"A 79-year-old woman with no past history of interest consulted for diarrhoea and general syndrome of one year's duration. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa which was confirmed by simple abdominal X-ray. An abdominal CT scan revealed the presence of a large hepatic mass with exophytic growth towards the right iliac fossa suggestive of hepatocarcinoma. The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, uterus and ovaries were normal. Hepatotropic virus serologies were negative and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were within normal limits. A fine needle puncture-aspiration of the lesion yielded material, histological examination of which showed a well-differentiated hepatocarcinoma. Once surgical resection was ruled out due to the size of the tumour and suspicion of vascular invasion, treatment with chemoembolisation was started with good results. At present, after six months of follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic.   "
"A 46-year-old man reported constipation and pain in the upper abdomen of 7 days' duration. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a mass measuring 11 x 12 x 7 cm depending on the descending colon and a left hemicolectomy was performed. Pathology showed a spindle cell tumour with low mitotic activity which, after ultrastructural and immunohistochemical (IHC) examination, was diagnosed as GANT. At 5 months he presented a double recurrence located in the transcavity of the omentum and adjacent to the wall of the cecum which was completely resected. Adjuvant treatment with imatinib 400 mg per day orally was performed. After 24 months of follow-up there have been no recurrences or metastases.   "
"A 28-year-old woman reported epigastralgia and constitutional syndrome of one month's duration. CT scan showed a 15 x 13 x 7 cm mass dependent on the ascending colon with bilobar liver metastases; a right hemicolectomy with liver biopsy was performed. Pathology showed a tumour consisting of spindle cells with high mitotic activity which, after ultrastructural examination and IHC, was diagnosed as GANT. Adjuvant treatment with imatinib 400 mg daily orally was performed. Follow-up CT scan at six months showed a partial reduction of liver metastases, complete remission at one year and after three years there was no evidence of local or distant recurrence.   "
"We present a case of leiomyosarcoma of the colon whose first manifestation was a pulmonary metastasis. The patient was a 74-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hysterectomy with double adnexectomy and subsequent brachytherapy for endometrial adenocarcinoma 5 years ago. She consulted for dyspnoea of 2 months' evolution, without associated cough, haemoptysis or general syndrome. Blood tests were normal. Chest X-ray and chest CT scan revealed a right parahilar mass measuring 5 x 3 cm. A biopsy of the mass was taken by bronchoscopy showing a mesenchymal tumour with positive imnunohistochemistry for vimentin and negative for c-KIT compatible with leiomyosarcoma.  An extension study was performed with gastroscopy, colonoscopy and abdominopelvic CT scan, which was negative. With a diagnosis of primary leiomyosarcoma of the right lung, a right pneumonectomy was performed, confirming the histology of leiomyosarcoma in the surgical specimen. One month after the right pneumonectomy, the patient presented with abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting and episodes of rectorrhagia. Colonoscopy showed a polylobulated mass with a neoplastic appearance in the ascending-blind colon and abdominal CT scan with dilatation of the small bowel loops showing a doughnut-shaped image at the level of the terminal ileum-blind ileum compatible with intestinal invagination with a probable underlying tumour lesion.  Emergency surgery was performed, revealing small bowel obstruction due to invagination of the terminal ileum at the level of the tumour in the cecum. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Histopathological study of the surgical specimen showed that it was a leiomyosarcoma measuring 6 x 4 x 2.8 cm, affecting the mucosa, submucosa, muscle and serosa with a high number of mitoses (more than 10 mitoses per 10 high magnification fields) and immunohistochemistry positive for actin and vimentin and negative for c-KIT. This finding demonstrates that the LMS had its origin in the colon and the lung tumour was metastatic. During this second postoperative period, the patient again presented respiratory complications and died one month after abdominal surgery.   "
"A 50-year-old man, diagnosed with Crohn's disease with complex ileal and perianal involvement on immunosuppressant treatment, who came to the emergency department with fever, perianal suppuration and diarrhoea of 1 week's evolution. The patient had been on salicylates and azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day, adjusted according to TPMT levels) for 2 years and had received 6 doses of infliximab, a biological treatment that he discontinued 6 months before the current admission, for work-related reasons. On physical examination, the patient appeared in poor general condition, being febrile (39 ºC), hypotensive (BP 80/40 mmHg), tachycardic (104 bpm) and tachypneic (22 rpm). In the right iliac fossa there was a palpable ""mass effect"" of increased consistency and a fistulous orifice in the left buttock over an indurated, erythematous, hot and painful area. Urgent laboratory tests showed anaemia (Hb 7.9 g/dl, Hct 29%), renal failure (creatinine 4 mg/dl) and elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 127, platelets 424,000/ml). With the probable diagnosis of sepsis and multifactorial renal failure (salicylates, dehydration, etc.), treatment was started with serum therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics. During the following 24 hours, the patient presented disorientation, agitation and deterioration of renal function with evident metabolic and hydroelectrolyte alterations (urea 68 mmol/l, creatinine 6.9 mg/dl, sodium 138 mmol/l, potassium 6 mmol/l, total calcium 7.5 mmol/l, inorganic phosphorus 5.1 mmol/l, LDH 17,481 U/l, urate 44 mg/dl). In view of these results, a renal Doppler ultrasound was performed, which was anodyne, and the renal failure was interpreted as multifactorial in origin, aggravated by the precipitation of uric acid crystals, for which treatment was started with hyperhydration, urine alkalinisation, haemodialysis, allopurinol and rasburicase, with a marked decrease in urate levels (urate 1.8 mg/dl). However, in view of the progressive clinical worsening of the patient's general condition, an abdominopelvic CT scan was performed, which showed a retroperitoneal mass measuring 13 x 10 cm and a lesion in the right flank measuring 15 x 8.6 cm, which appeared to correspond to a conglomerate of fixed loops with a thickened wall, without being able to rule out an underlying neoplasm. Multiple adenopathies in the mesenteric, iliac and inguinal chains were also observed, as well as a left perirectal lesion, probably related to his history of abscess and perianal fistula. The latter lesion was the only radiological finding observed, two months before the current episode, in an abdomino-pelvic MRI to monitor his perianal disease. Despite supportive treatment, the patient continued with fever, decreased level of consciousness, progressive dyspnoea and anuria, and died three days after admission to the ward. The definitive diagnosis was obtained after necropsy: plasmoblastic plasmacytoma with a predominance of lamda-type light chains infiltrating terminal ileum and cecum, root of the mesentery, abdominal lymph nodes and bone marrow.   "
"A 54 year old woman attended the emergency department for 5 days with progressive pain starting in the right iliac fossa, associated with hyporexia and without alterations in intestinal transit, micturition symptoms or previous local trauma. History of arterial hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treated with enalapril and acetylsalicylic acid. On examination, the abdomen was distended, painful at the level of the right iliac fossa with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities except for elevated acute phase reactants (fibrinogen 811 mg/dl and CRP 12 mg/dl). Computed tomography (CT) showed a 4 x 3 x 5 cm mass adjacent to the cecal pole with an 8 mm appendix, which suggested acute appendicitis versus a complicated neoformative process. A laparoscopic approach was initially used, finding a haematoma with mass effect at the level of the cecum and free bloody fluid, so it was decided to convert and perform a right hemicolectomy with an uneventful postoperative period. The pathological anatomy was reported as an area of haematic extravasation at the level of subserosal tissues of the cecum with foci of abscessification without histological signs of malignancy.   "
"A 73-year-old woman was admitted for scheduled surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, undergoing subtotal gastrectomy with reconstruction by Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. As a previous history there was a probable allergy to vitamin B (Neuromade®). Postoperatively, the patient developed a fistula of the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which was managed conservatively, with cutaneous exteriorisation, forcing the initiation of parenteral nutrition (TPN) without thiamine supplementation. One month later, she presented with neurological deterioration consisting of disorientation, bradypsychia, sleep tendency, horizontal nystagmus and ophthalmoparesis, which led to her admission to the intensive care unit for an intradermal thiamine test. This was negative and he was given controlled administration of thiamine with complete recovery of the clinical picture.   "
"A 67-year-old male patient, active smoker, with no personal history of interest, who came for endoscopic examination due to progressive dysphagia of solids and liquids of one year's evolution, with occasional odynophagia, without weight loss, hyporexia or fever. Gastroscopy revealed an irregular, pearly mucosa in the supracardial region, with circular eroded areas and other ulcerated areas covered with fibrin, producing partial stenosis of the oesophageal lumen, which made it difficult for the endoscope to pass through, and was highly suggestive of oesophageal carcinoma. The rest of the examination was normal.  Six biopsies were taken from the lesion described. Histologically, the samples correspond to thick strips of flat polystratified oesophageal epithelium, partially furrowed by connective-vascular axes, which conserve a normal maturational gradient and stratification, including small foci of oedema and leukocyte exocytosis, one of them also shows phenomena of superficial parakeratinisation, associated with eosinophilic masses with a fibrino-necrotic appearance, and bi- and multinucleated cells, compatible with a viral infection (Herpex simplex virus).   "
"A 52-year-old man, with no past history of interest, was studied after an abdominal ultrasound scan for a urological study revealed an intrahepatic cystic tumour which at first appeared to be an uncomplicated complex hepatic cyst. An abdominal CT scan was requested in which a cystic image of about 5 centimetres (cm) in diameter was found located between segments V and VIII in the shape of a bunch of grapes, with septa in its interior, some of which were thick and attracted significant contrast in some areas. Tumour markers were negative. Given the asymptomatic nature of the picture, it was decided to follow up. In the radiological control carried out one year later, the lesion increased in size (9 x 7 x 7 x 7 cm) and was located in the porto-biliary confluence, without compressing it. Given the growth of the lesion, it was decided to operate on the patient given the possibility of malignancy of the lesion.  During surgery, a cystic, polylobulated tumour was observed at the junction of segments IV and V, bulging towards the hilum. The intraoperative biopsy was reported as a mucinous tumour without being able to rule out malignancy. Given the possibility of a cystadenocarcinoma, a radical excision of the specimen was decided, and complete resection could not be performed. Dissection revealed fistulisation of the tumour to the right hepatic duct, outflow of mucinous content and intracystic polypoid lesions. The definitive histological diagnosis was mucosecretory cystadenocarcinoma which, as it occurred in a male patient, was more aggressive. The evolution has been favourable, with adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and no recurrence at one year follow-up.   "
"92-year-old woman, with no known drug allergies, with a personal history of arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic atrial fibrillation and Alzheimer's disease. She was admitted for vomiting in coffee grounds, epigastralgia and weight loss in the last month. Physical examination was irrelevant. Laboratory tests showed: haemoglobin 7.1 g/dl, haematocrit 23.8%, MCV 77, leukocytes 11,940, ESR 40 mm. Glucose 206 mg/dl. Iron 28 ug/dl. An oral endoscopy showed a large hiatal hernia and a deep ulcer of approximately 2 cm in diameter in the distal third of the oesophagus with abundant whitish exudate in the crater. A biopsy and cytology of the lesion was performed. Histology showed esophageal squamous esophageal mucosa and numerous sulphide granules containing abundant hyphae consistent with actinomycosis.  Treatment was started with intravenous penicillin G for a few days and subsequently discharged with oral penicillin. The patient was lost to follow-up.   "
"A 47-year-old woman who, with no previous digestive symptoms, was found to have carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels of 20.2 ng/ml in a routine follow-up analysis by her gynaecologist. She underwent: a) an abdomino-pelvic ultrasound scan that revealed the presence of a 6.5 x 5.6 cm retrouterine mass that appeared to be dependent on the right adnexa; b) a complete colonoscopy with no findings; and c) a diagnostic laparoscopy that revealed the presence of a mass dependent on the cecum, highly vascularised and with a smooth whitish surface, with both adnexa normal and a hypoplastic uterus. Referred to our department, a computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the existence of a pelvic mass of cystic appearance measuring 11 x 8 cm, anterosuperior to the bladder and close to the terminal ileum, which was encapsulated and without signs of infiltration of neighbouring organs, ascites or adenomegaly in the vicinity. Elective surgery was performed, describing the presence of an appendicular mucocele of 12 cm in diameter with no free fluid or implants in the peritoneum, and an oncological right ileocolectomy with ileotransverse anastomosis was performed; the postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the 5th postoperative day.  The histopathological study of the specimen showed an ileocaecal appendix measuring 9 x 5.5 cm occupied by mucoid material, being reported as ""mucocele secondary to appendiceal mucinous tumour of uncertain malignant potential""; it was not possible to certify the degree of local invasion due to parietal calcification. The eight lymph nodes isolated from the resection specimen were free of neoplasia.  After 3 years of follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic and her most recent tumour markers and CT scans are absolutely normal.   "
"A 53-year-old man consulted for the appearance of intense pain in the left iliac fossa with no other associated symptoms. He denied the existence of fever. He did not refer to usual home treatment or personal or family history of interest. Physical examination revealed slight overweight and painful palpation at the level of the left iliac fossa, together with abdominal defence. Bowel sounds and the rest of the examination were normal. General laboratory tests showed a GGT of 88 U/l, ferritin of 297.11 ng/ml and CRP of 7 mg/dl. All other parameters were normal. The clinical manifestations were suggestive of acute diverticulitis. Given the persistence and intensity of the pain, as well as to confirm the suspected diagnosis, a CT scan of the abdomen was performed, which revealed sigmoid diverticulosis with no signs of diverticulitis. An upper abdominal section showed inflammation of the fat adjacent to the descending colon, which corresponded to an epiploic appendix, probably in the context of acute appendagitis secondary to twisting of the appendix.  The patient was diagnosed with ""appendagitis"" or ""epiploic appendagitis"" and received conservative treatment with oral anti-inflammatory drugs for 7 days, with progressive improvement of symptoms and no complications. Antibiotics and hospitalisation were not necessary.   "
"A 33-year-old woman consulted for abdominal pain of two months' duration located in the right iliac fossa with no other accompanying symptoms. The patient visited several hospitals, where she was discharged with normal basic complementary tests. She attended the emergency department of our hospital due to the persistence of her symptoms. An abdominal Doppler ultrasound was performed, showing a hypervascularised nodule measuring one centimetre in diameter in the right iliac fossa. The patient was admitted to our department with the diagnostic presumption of endometrioma in order to complete the studies. The CT scan performed during admission revealed a single nodule measuring 1 x 1.5 cm located in the appendix. The patient underwent an exploratory laparoscopy which identified the appendix with no inflammatory signs and the nodule described above. Anatomopathological examination of the removed specimen revealed macroscopically a hard nodule at the tip of the appendix, which was reported as a granular cell tumour. The lesion extends into the subserosal adipose tissue of the appendix.  Histologically, the proliferating cell is medium to large with a large cytoplasm and small nuclei with a patent nucleolus and prominent eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical techniques show positivity for S100 protein.  Once the histological diagnosis was known, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed, which did not detect any other lesions.   "
"We present the case of a 77-year-old patient with a history of arterial hypertension and ischaemic heart disease who was under study due to non-specific abdominal discomfort and anaemia of recent onset. He attended our centre on a scheduled basis for colonoscopy after bowel preparation with Bohn's evacuating solution. During the procedure, he suffered an intestinal perforation at the level of the sigmoid colon, for which reason he underwent urgent surgery and was found to have a perforation 1 centimetre long with clean edges that was sutured by simple suture, leaving a penrose drain. He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in the immediate postoperative period. On arrival at the ICU, broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered and microbiological samples were taken. Among the complementary tests performed, a serial quantification of PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) was carried out, with normal CRP values (0.25 mg/dl) and slightly elevated PCT values (0.6 ng/ml). Measurements taken 2 hours and 12 hours after the patient's admission to the ICU showed a significant increase in PCT values (12.73 and 220 ng/ml) while CRP values were only slightly elevated (0.8 and 15.5 mg/dl). The culture of the abdominal drainage isolated Enterobacter cloacae sensitive to the antibiotic regimen administered. Subsequent evolution was favourable and he was discharged 72 hours after admission to the ICU.   "
"A 66-year-old man, of Vietnamese origin and currently residing in the USA, came to the emergency department of our centre after presenting with sudden, sharp pain in the epigastrium associated with a large meal. The pain radiated to the left shoulder. Examination revealed sweating and mucocutaneous pallor with preserved distal pulses. The patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, his ECG was normal and, given the urgency of the symptoms, an abdominal ultrasound scan was requested, which revealed a mass in liver segment VI suggestive of hepatocarcinoma and the existence of free intracavitary fluid; an abdominal CT scan was then performed with contrast, which revealed very abundant haemoperitoneum and a lesion in liver segment VI compatible with hepatocarcinoma, probably ruptured and with a hyperdense focus next to the lesion, suggesting active bleeding. The blood test showed haemoglobin figures of 8.8 g/l, haematocrit of 0.249 L/L and 14,310 leukocytes with neutrophilia. Given the instability of the patient and the findings of the imaging tests, we decided to perform urgent surgery. At laparotomy, the lesion described in the ultrasound and CT scan was identified and it was decided to perform a segmentectomy, lavage and drainage of the cavity. After 7 days (4 of them in the Intensive Care Unit) the patient was discharged from hospital.   "
"A 54-year-old man with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, with a personal history of hyperlipidaemia under treatment and a previous fistulotomy. Six years earlier, he had had an episode of moderate-severe acute pancreatitis that required hospitalisation. Ten months ago, he presented a new episode requiring ERCP, which led to a recurrence of acute pancreatitis (interval of 5 days). As complementary tests, a magnetic resonance cholangiography showed chronic pancreatitis on pancreas divisum and atrophy of the hepatic parenchyma, and an ERCP also showed signs of chronic pancreatitis and pancreas divisum.  Surgical intervention was decided, performing caudal pancreatectomy and pancreatico-jejunal bypass. A tumour was found on the anterior gastric wall, which was reported intraoperatively as GIST and was removed. After surgery, the patient was admitted to the ICU, where he progressed satisfactorily. On the 5th postoperative day he was transferred to the ward, where the drainage became purulent. After treatment with antibiotic therapy, the patient's evolution was satisfactory and he was discharged on the 19th day.   "
"A 46-year-old woman with dyspepsia of several years' duration that did not improve with medical-dietary treatment. Endoscopy revealed a submucosal lesion 1 cm in diameter, located on the posterior aspect of the gastric antrum with no signs of ulceration. The biopsy was suggestive of moderate congestion and focal oedema of the lamina propria. An antral gastrointestinal transit (GIT) and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a repletion defect with loss of mucosal folds compatible with the previously described tumour. During the follow-up, several endoscopic ultrasound scans (EUS) were performed, showing a hypoechoic, homogeneous lesion with regular borders, which appeared to depend on the muscular layer, measuring 2 x 1.6 cm with a soft consistency, compatible with a stromal tumour of the leiomyoma type, with no ultrasound signs suggesting malignancy. No significant adenopathy. FNA: epithelial cellularity without malignancy.  The increase in size of the lesion, the persistence of symptoms, the absence of a definitive diagnosis and the impossibility of ruling out malignancy led us to consider surgical removal. Excision was performed laparoscopically, identifying the lesion by means of intraoperative endoscopy and Chinese ink staining prior to surgery. An anterior gastrostomy is performed and the resection is carried out with a 45 mm linear endograft (Ethicon Endo-surgery). Subsequently, the gastrostomy is closed with a continuous silk suture. Macroscopically, the lesion has a solid consistency and the external surface is yellowish-whitish in colour. Microscopic examination identified heterotopic pancreatic tissue with a predominance of irregularly dilated ducts. The postoperative period was uneventful and oral intake was resumed on the 4th day and the patient was discharged on the 7th day. The patient is currently asymptomatic.   "
"This is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, osteoporosis and hysterectomy for myomatosis at the age of 50. She underwent transurethral resection of infiltrating bladder carcinoma in October 2006. She subsequently received radiotherapy sessions up to a total of 50 Gy due to persistence of an external tumour mass in the right angle of the bladder, finishing this treatment in June 2007. In August 2007 she began chemotherapy treatment due to persistence of the bladder lesion and metastases in the spine detected by follow-up CT scan and bone scintigraphy. Her digestive history began in February 2008 when she was admitted for episodes of rectorrhagia, initially scarce and distal, but which soon became more frequent and profuse, accompanied by symptoms of haemodynamic instability and severe anaemia with extensive transfusion requirements. Total colonoscopy was performed, showing only changes typical of actinic proctitis with large friable and bleeding neovascular lesions; treatment was carried out with argon plasma (APC). The patient's clinical course was unfavourable: she received consecutive treatment with steroid enemas, 5-aminosalicylic acid and sucralfate; in addition, three more therapeutic rectoscopies were performed, applying APC treatment, despite which the episodes of profuse rectorrhagia with haemodynamic instability persisted, requiring transfusion of a total of 21 red blood cell concentrates throughout the patient's hospitalisation period, despite also receiving oral and intravenous ferrotherapy. In the absence of response to these treatments, the case was discussed with the surgeon for topical treatment with formalin, who, using spinal anaesthesia and anal dilatation, treated the rectal ampulla for 10 minutes with a 10% formalin solution 200 ml + 300 ml of water; The patient's tolerance to the procedure was excellent, it was carried out without any complications and from that moment onwards the patient was completely asymptomatic without new episodes of haemorrhagic externalisation, haemodynamic instability or new transfusion requirements; she was discharged and a follow-up colonoscopy was proposed after the treatment, but she did not accept. Four months later, she was admitted again for clinical signs of tumour progression, and symptomatic treatment was decided by the Oncology Department, and the patient died, but without recurrence of the rectorrhagia.   "
"We present the case of a 43-year-old man, with a history of diabetes, who was admitted for moderate acute pancreatitis. Two weeks later, he reported acute pain in the left hemiabdomen and nausea, with no other symptoms. On examination, a large occupation of the left hemiabdomen was palpated without peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests: elevated triglycerides and lipase, other biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation normal. During the examination, the patient suffered syncope and his haematocrit dropped from 40 to 21%, requiring transfusion of 6 red blood cell concentrates, and he remained stable. Imaging tests revealed a haemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst measuring 17 x 27 cm in diameter. The patient was admitted to the ICU where he remained stable. One week later, the patient was scheduled for surgery with a cysto-jejunostomy. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged one week after the operation.   "
"An 83-year-old woman with a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia and chronic atrial fibrillation consulted for progressive abdominal pain and constitutional syndrome of one month's duration. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile and haemodynamically stable, with a globular, soft, depressible abdomen, painful on palpation and a tumour on the left flank. Blood tests showed haemoglobin 9.3 g/dl, leukocytes 11,300 /mm3, urea 109 mg/dl, creatinine 1 mg/dl, total bilirubin 2.6, alkaline phosphatase 139 U/l, with the rest of the liver function normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass measuring 20 x 20 x 15 centimetres of heterogeneous density that caused displacement of the renal vessels and pyelocaliceal system without causing obstructive uropathy or metastatic involvement. Surgery involved a radical left nephrectomy with complete excision of the mass. The patient died one month after surgery due to acute pulmonary oedema. Pathological anatomy showed a 3.5 kg tumour of mucoid appearance with areas of haemorrhage affecting 30%, and in its centre the rejected nephrectomy specimen but without parenchymal infiltration, compatible with a mixed liposarcoma (dedifferentiated and myxoid), with a mitotic index of 2/10 high magnification fields.   "
"We present the case of a 58-year-old patient with a personal history of obesity, hypertension, fibromyalgia and D3-D4 disc herniation. She was admitted to another hospital due to clinical symptoms of several months' evolution consisting of lumbosciatica refusing the usual analgesic treatment, a feeling of retrosternal knot, progressive dysphagia and weight loss, where she underwent: - Cervicothoracoabdominal CT scan: a mass effect was observed in the upper third of the oesophagus, and its exact nature could not be defined. - Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: a brownish-black mass was observed in the upper third of the oesophagus, submucosal, non-ulcerated, with an intense vascular network. - Dorsal CT and MRI: multiple vertebral lesions (in D7 and from D9 to D12) compatible with osteoporotic vertebral crushing. - Bone scan and tumour markers: negative. Diagnosed with lumbosciatica due to multiple vertebral lesions of osteoporotic origin in the dorsal spine and oesophageal mass, she was referred to our department to complete the study. On arrival, the patient presented with low back pain that made ambulation impossible, not yielding to opioid treatment and dysphagia with liquids. On examination she was in very poor general condition, haemodynamically stable and afebrile. She had an abdomen with palpable hepatomegaly measuring 3 cm in diameter and severe pain on palpation of the dorsal spine. At this time the following complementary tests were performed: - Echoendoscopy: lesion located 18 cm from the dental arch, size 40 x 35 x 18 mm, heterogeneous density, infiltrating and rupturing serosa. No peripheral adenopathies were seen. - Abdominal ultrasound: liver metastases in segment IV and II of 22 and 26 mm in greatest diameter, respectively. The rest of the examination showed no significant alterations. - Positron emission tomography: uptake in the form of a tumour mass in the upper third of the oesophagus, with mesenteric implants, multiple liver metastases and bone metastases in the axial and peripheral skeleton. - Pathological anatomy: malignant melanoma -HMB45: (+), MELAN A: (+), CKPAN: (+)- with areas of necrosis.   "
"A 74-year-old man with a history of ischaemic heart disease treated with beta-blockers, isosorbide mononitrate, antiplatelet agents and proton pump inhibitors. He was referred to the Digestive System for a 9-month history of intense asthenia, anorexia and progressive increase in sweating, with a weight loss of 15 kg, associated with diffuse abdominal pain and abdominal distension. Laboratory tests revealed iron deficiency anaemia. Among other diagnostic tests, a colonoscopy under sedation was requested. An initial colonoscopy was performed, revealing from the rectum to the cecum an infinity of sessile lesions with a polypoid appearance of between 3-6 mm, more frequent in number in the right colon and forming conglomerates at the level of the ileocaecal valve, also affecting the terminal ileum. The pathological anatomy of biopsies at different levels showed non-specific colitis with lymphoid follicular hyperplasia and an eosinophilic infiltrate of up to 60% of inflammatory cells. After the results obtained and in view of the patient's progressive clinical worsening, it was decided to perform a gastroscopy and repeat the colonoscopy to take new biopsies. Multiple sessile polypoid lesions of different sizes (larger than 8-9 mm) were observed in the gastric and duodenal mucosa. They were irregular and bulging with marked vascularisation, some eroded at the apex, decreasing in number as the patient progressed towards the distal duodenum, and the lesions described in the previous colonoscopy were also confirmed. The histopathological result of the gastric, duodenal and colon biopsies was a dense diffuse lymphoid infiltrate in the mucosa and submucosa with glandular destruction and lymphoepithelial lesion, with small-sized lymphocytes and centrocytoid habitus with positivity for CD 20, cyclin D1, and bcl-2 with a Ki-67 of 30%, all compatible with gastric, small intestine and colon infiltration by mantle lymphoma. After the endoscopic findings, the patient was referred to the haematology department where studies were completed, confirming the definitive diagnosis of stage IVB non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the mantle with gastric, small and large intestine involvement.   "
"82-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulant treatment, diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. She was admitted for obstructive jaundice secondary to choledocholithiasis. Therapeutic ERCP was performed with conscious sedation (midazolam-propofol and remifentanil), technically laborious, lasting 150 minutes. Suddenly at the end of the intervention he presented haemodynamic and respiratory instability. An abdominal computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan with direct intravenous contrast was performed as an emergency, showing a hypervascular image in the anterior pole of the spleen compatible with an area of splenic contusion, with free intra-abdominal fluid, mainly in the perisplenic region, left paracolic gout, perihepatic and also in the pelvis with intermediate density compatible with blood. The patient was transferred to the operating theatre with deterioration of general condition. An urgent laparotomy was performed, evacuating 2000 ml of haemoperitoneum due to a tear in the anterior splenic border in the area visualised by CT scan. Splenectomy, cholecystectomy, duodenostomy and extraction of the biliary mould with subsequent placement of a Kher tube were performed. There was no evidence of duodenal perforation.  Postoperatively, she presented a picture of septic shock due to biliary peritonitis, treated empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam, and the need for re-laparotomy, finding a biliary fistula due to the exit of the Kher tube. She was discharged from the resuscitation unit 12 days after admission. The pathological anatomy report of the splenectomy specimen showed the existence of a solution of continuity of the capsule on its inner side. The rest of the parenchyma was unaltered.   "
"A 27-year-old woman with a debut of the disease two years ago in the form of severe pancolitis and subsequent corticodependence, on maintenance treatment with azatriopine and oral mesalazine. He was admitted for abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea and headache accompanied by motor deficits in the left lower limb. Physical examination: diffuse abdominal pain on deep palpation. Rectal examination with fresh haematic debris. Discrete functional impotence in the left lower limb and paraesthesia in both upper limbs. Laboratory tests on admission showed haemoglobin 11 g/dl, ESR 78 mg/l and minimal enzyme mobilisation (GOT 74 IU/l, GPT 96 IU/l, GGT 182 IU/l, FA 148 IU/l). Neurological assessment indicated computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, showing thrombosis of the longitudinal venous sinus. Rectosigmoidoscopy: severe mucosal involvement from the anal margin. Biopsies compatible with active ulcerative colitis, ruling out infection by cytomegalovirus. Treatment was started with intravenous corticosteroids at full doses (1 mg/kg/day) and low molecular weight heparin, with progressive normalisation of bowel movements. After a week of hospitalisation, increased abdominal perimeter with semiology of ascites and neurological deterioration (myoclonias in lower limbs, decreased visual acuity), accompanied by increased cytolysis (GOT 600 IU/l, GPT 463 IU/l) and coagulopathy. Abdominal Doppler ultrasound was performed: hepatomegaly. Porta of 9.5 mm capturing Doppler only in its right branch. Prominent hepatic artery. Suprahepatic with minimal flow uptake, flattened. Echogenic content in inferior cava. Ascites. Further study by CT and abdominal angio-MRI: intrahepatic cava decreased in calibre with image of intraluminal thrombus. Loss of signal intensity of the suprahepatic vessels along their entire length. Porta permeable. Hepatomegaly. Ascites.  Other causes of liver disease were ruled out and a diagnostic paracentesis was performed (leucocytes 20, glucose 86, protein 1.8, albumin 1.4, GASA 1. Cytology negative). Study of thrombophilia with relative deficit of hepatic synthesis factors (factor V 36.63%, VII 21%), without primary procoagulant disorder (antiphospholipid antibody, Ham's test and Leyden's factor V, negative. Prothrombin and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene, homocysteine, antithrombin III, protein C and S were normal). With suspicion of Budd-Chiari syndrome, treatment with full-dose sodium heparin is started. Clinical deterioration continued over the following days, with tension ascites and severe coagulopathy (prothrombin activity 38%). After multidisciplinary assessment, the patient was transferred to another centre for attempted placement of a percutaneous intrahepatic percutaneous portosystemic shunt system, from which we were informed of the need for joint fibrinolysis due to associated portal thrombosis. The subsequent evolution was torpid with the appearance of haemorrhagic complications at different levels, including a massive cerebral haemorrhage and the patient's final death.   "
"JL, a 46-year-old white female, consulted in February 2000 for facial asymmetry and difficulty using her lower prosthesis. She presented with an enlargement of the left parasymphyseal volume of 1 year's duration, of slow growth, which had stabilised in recent months, and she did not recall any history of trauma in the area. The oral examination revealed a complete upper and lower edentulous patient. In the left anterior mandibular area there was a mass expanding the vestibular and lingual cortex, covered by healthy mucosa in which telangectasias were observed. On palpation, the borders were clear, there was crepitation of the vestibular cortex and perforation of the lingual cortex. The objective and subjective neurological examination confirmed that there was no involvement of the inferior alveolar nerve, Vincent's sign (-).  Imaging examination revealed a radiolucent lesion with radiopaque areas within, unilocular, approximately 6 cm in greatest diameter, with defined boundaries and no corticalisation. The lesion extended from approximately the left premolar area to the right incisor area across the midline. It deformed and thinned the mandibular basal and displaced the inferior alveolar canal.  The protocol described above for the treatment of LCG was implemented. Two series of intralesional corticosteroids were performed. The first series was performed between March and April 2000 and the 2nd series started in September 2000, 5 months after the completion of the 1st series. Fifteen months after the start of treatment, in May 2001, because the lesion had not disappeared and the bone cortices did not allow passage of the needle to attempt a new series of infiltrations, it was decided to perform surgical enucleation. Under general anaesthesia and through a buccal approach the lesion was accessed. Contrary to expectations, we did not find a bleeding, friable lesion corresponding to the macroscopic characteristics of LCGs, but rather an increase in bone volume without clear limits with the normal bone structure. Surgical remodelling of the lesion with drills was performed.  The patient is now clinically cured 39 months after initiation of treatment and 24 months after surgical remodelling, with no midfacial midline deviation and a lower alveolar ridge suitable for prosthetic use.   "
"FP, a 22-year-old black woman, who consulted in November 2000, due to facial asymmetry, pain and a sensation of crepitus at the left infraorbital level. She presented a tumour of progressive growth in the left hemimaxillary region of 5 months of evolution. On facial examination, an increase in volume was observed in the left infraorbital region, which markedly raised the lower eyelid, making it difficult for the patient to look down and to the right. There was deformation of the nasal pyramid and obstruction of the left nostril due to reduced permeability as a result of the elevation of the nasal floor and deformation of the nasal intersinus septum.  The patient did not present ocular alterations, she reported that she felt the lesion growing and that she presented anterior nasal corrsion which was not objectified. The oral examination showed a stable and repeatable occlusion, caries in tooth 24 and mobility and displacement of tooth 22. A large mass of diffuse limits, covered by healthy and erythematous mucosa, deformed the left upper labial vestibule and the palatal vault. On palpation, the lesion had crepitant and soft areas, was asymptomatic, and had clear boundaries. Orthopantomography showed a unilocular homogeneous radiolucent mass of approximately 5.5 cm in greatest diameter, located in a shape corresponding to a lesion in a maxillary globular position20 , displacing the roots of teeth 22 and 23 and with rhizolysis of both roots. It also displaced the maxillary sinus and reached the infraorbital rim, with clear boundaries but no corticalisation. In the CT scan, axial and coronal slices showed a radiolucent mass with trabeculations inside, extending from the alveolar ridge to the infraorbital rim, raising the left floor and destroying the intersinuso-nasal wall at the bottom, coming into contact with the nasal septum. It expanded and thinned the cortices and in some areas perforated them.  The protocol described above for the treatment of GCL was implemented. A series of infiltrations were performed between December 2000 and January 2001. At the end of this period, the patient informed that she was pregnant and all treatment was suspended until the end of the pregnancy. In October 2001, almost a month after delivery, the patient returned, reporting that she no longer felt the crepitus. On physical examination the lesion was more localised and on palpation the entire lesion was bony in consistency. On CT scan, axial and coronal slices showed an image which, unlike the lesion on the initial CT scans, was radiopaque with a radiolucent central nucleus. Its boundaries were indistinguishable from healthy bone.  In view of these findings, 11 months after the start of treatment, it was decided to perform surgical enucleation. Under general anaesthesia and through a buccal approach, the lesion was accessed. As in case 1, an increase in bone volume was found without clear boundaries with the normal bone structure. Surgical remodelling of the lesion was performed with drills. It was necessary to reshape the infraorbital rim and the piriform notch.  Clinically and radiographically, at 22 months follow-up there is no evidence of residual lesion or recurrence. Root canal treatment was not performed on the 22nd and 23rd teeth, which are healthy. Currently, the patient is clinically cured 28 months after the start of treatment and 17 months after surgical remodelling.   "
"We present the case of a 68-year-old patient with absence of hair on the scalp, with a history of right inguinal hernia that had not been operated on and with actinic keratosis that had been present for years, initially treated with retinoids and cryotherapy. Two years later the patient reported the appearance of several crusty lesions in the parieto-occipital region. Biopsies of the lesions were taken and reported as moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesions were excised, leaving one of the margins of the resection affected by the tumour. The patient was given maximum dose radiotherapy to the scalp. Six months later the patient reported the appearance of several lesions similar to the previous ones in the same area. New biopsies were taken and reported as squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was then referred to our department to assess the therapeutic possibilities. On arrival the patient presented two crusty lesions of approximately 2 and 3 cm in diameter respectively and other smaller lesions suspicious of malignancy. Likewise, as a consequence of the radiotherapy, there was fibrosis and complete retraction of the scalp which prevented any type of reconstruction by means of local flaps. During the clinical session, it was decided to perform a wide scalp resection and immediate reconstruction of the defect with a free omentum flap, as well as a herniorrhaphy to reduce the inguinal hernia that the patient presented.   The patient is operated on together with the General Surgery Service and a two-team approach is performed simultaneously. On the one hand, a wide scalp excision is performed together with a bilateral preauricular approach to identify and isolate the superficial temporal vessels. On the other hand, a median laparotomy is performed. Once the abdominal cavity has been explored, the omentum is tractioned and dissected from the transverse mesocolon upwards. The vascular pedicle corresponding to the right gastroepiploic vessels is then identified and the small vascular branches leading to the posterior and anterior area of the greater curvature of the stomach are exposed and ligated. Once the vascular pedicle of the greater curvature of the stomach is freed, the pedicle of the left gastroepiploic artery is ligated, leaving the omentum pediculated to the right gastroepiploic artery and ready to be transferred to the defect area. The omentum is then sutured to the remaining scalp and anastomoses are performed. Some authors use both vascular pedicles with double anastomoses to the facial and superficial temporal vessels.8 In our case we performed the anastomoses using only the right gastroepiploic pedicle and the superficial temporal artery and vein as recipient vessels. Finally, the entire omentum flap is covered with a meshed dermoepidermal graft and a compressive bandage is applied for 1 week. The surgical specimen reported as moderately differentiated epidermoid carcinomas and two carcinomas in situ, all with disease-free resection margins. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged 12 days after surgery. The patient is followed up in multiple revisions and, 2 years after surgery, shows no signs of local recurrence. From an aesthetic point of view, the patient is very satisfied with the result as the skin mesh marks have disappeared with time and it is a uniform tissue along the entire scalp.    "
"A 56-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery department with progressive dysphagia of 6 months' duration. She also reported an accentuated foreign body sensation on swallowing. His personal history includes psychomotor retardation with borderline IQ and functional limitation of the right lower limb. She was short in stature and hypothyroidism, which had never been assessed. The intraoral examination revealed a vaguely purplish, vascularised, hard and non-painful tumour on palpation in the lingual midline behind the foramen caecum. The visible tumour surface is not ulcerated. No cervical lymph nodes were palpated. An MRI scan was requested showing a uniform mass at the base of the tongue measuring approximately 5 x 4 cm compatible with lingual thyroid with severe obstruction of the airway. The study was completed with an isotopic scintigraphy with Tc99 which showed accentuated uptake at the base of the tongue with no uptake in the usual pre-laryngeal hyoid position. The patient was referred to an endocrinologist to check his thyroid function and with the diagnosis of lingual thyroid, surgery was decided given the progressive obstructive dysphagia.  Under general anaesthesia, a tracheostomy was initially performed to adequately secure the airway given the large size and posterior location of the tumour at the base of the tongue. A suprahyoid mid cervicotomy is performed, combined with deperiostealisation of the mandibular lingual table and posterior lingual pull-through to increase surgical control at the time of resection. Given the deep posterior location of the tumour, an exsanguinating median glossotomy is required, which allows complete tumour excision under direct control without associated injury to vital adjacent structures. Finally, the approach routes are closed in planes.  The patient had an excellent evolution and was decannulated in the immediate postoperative period. The pathological anatomy confirms the diagnosis of lingual thyroid. The follow-up MRI showed an absence of lingual thyroid tissue.  She was followed up by us and by the endocrinologist for regular check-ups to monitor her baseline hypothyroidism.  "
"A 28-year-old male patient came to our department presenting with left hemimandibular pain and fever. He had no pathological history of interest. Physical examination showed no specific signs, but there was pain on palpation of the pericoronary tissues of the lower left third molar. A blood test was carried out in the emergency department showing a slight increase in the number of leukocytes, with no other notable alterations. The orthopantomography (OPG) showed both third molars included, in mesioangular position, with follicular sacs, the right one being larger.  With the suspicion of a possible infection of odontogenic cause (pericoronaritis) antibiotic treatment was started, with complete resolution of the symptoms. Exodontia of both lower wisdom teeth was recommended. Histological examination confirmed the presence of a follicular sac associated with the wisdom tooth, formed by non-keratinised polystratified epithelium. After the extraction of the lower left third molar, the patient did not return to complete the treatment. After 20 months he consulted again for pain at the level of the lower right third molar. The OPG showed a large radiolucent image around the crown of the right lower third molar.  With the diagnostic suspicion of a dentigerous cyst associated with the third molar, surgery was performed with exodontia of the tooth and cystectomy. The anatomopathological study confirmed the presumptive diagnosis as a lesion with a connective tissue wall lined on the inside by a stratified epithelium of keratinised ciliated cells and cells with abundant mucin. At the three-month check-up, the residual cavity created by the cyst was found to have undergone active ossification (with the formation of bone trabeculae).   "
"A 38-year-old man was referred by his doctor to the emergency department for assessment of a lesion on his lower lip that had been present for a month and a half. He has a personal history of unaffiliated hepatitis, tonsillectomy in childhood and a homosexual habit. One and a half months ago, the patient noticed the appearance of a lesion on his lower lip that partially improved after treatment with acyclovir by his GP but worsened when he stopped taking it. The patient also reported lesions on the scrotum and left foot of recent onset. Physical examination revealed a 2 cm ulcerated lesion on the left side of the vermilion of the lower lip, with an indurated base, not painful on palpation. The neck was negative for adenopathy. No other lesions were observed in the head and neck area. Simultaneously, on the left foot there was a 0.5 cm interdigital ulcerated lesion with a smooth surface and serous exudate and multiple smaller, rounded, copper-red, painless to the touch macules on the sole of the same foot. Finally, he had several small lesions on the scrotum (smaller than 0.5 cm) with an ulcerated appearance in different stages of resolution and painful to palpation. The rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.  A biopsy of the lip lesion was performed, which was inconclusive, and laboratory tests were requested to screen for HBV (HBsAg: negative, Anti-HBc: positive, quantitative Anti-HBs: >1000 mIU/ml -positive), HCV (G-ELISA: negative), HIV (Immunoblot: positive, IgG ELISA: positive, ELISA (2nd technique): positive, Load (Chiron): 3.69 Log HIV-RNA copies/ml, Lymphocyte population (CD 3+): CD 4: 43%, CD 8: 56%, CD 4/CD8 ratio: 0.77, CD 4 absolute values: 762 cells/ul, CD 8 absolute values: 992 cells/ul), syphilis (RPR: 1/64 Positive. HAART: Positive. ELISA capture G: Positive (treponemal test)) and tuberculosis (Mantoux: negative). No complementary CSF study was performed due to the absence of neurological symptoms and short evolution. With the diagnosis of syphilis in a patient with HIV, the patient was treated with a single dose of Penicillin G Benzathine (2.4 mill U) i.m. with complete resolution of the lesions in two weeks. Serological control at 6 months confirmed the resolution of the picture.   "
"A 59-year-old Caucasian male was referred to our department referring to lancinating pain in the left mandibular body and hypoaesthesia of the lip and chin on the same side for the last month. The intraoral examination was normal. A radiographic study was carried out using orthopantomography and CT scan, which revealed the presence of a well-defined osteolytic lesion of approximately 2.5 cm in diameter located at the level of the left ascending mandibular branch. The lesion was biopsied. Histological examination showed an image compatible with a metastatic adenocarcinoma lesion, probably of the mucosecretory type. A bone scan was then performed which showed areas of hyperenhancement in the left mandibular ascending ramus, left vertebral body at the level of T12, 8th right rib and in the costochondral junction of the 6th right rib. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan showed a large mass affecting the gastric body and gastric antrum, with regional adenopathies and a nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung. Combined treatment with radio and chemotherapy was administered. The patient died 2 months later. Autopsy confirmed the gastric origin of the metastasis.   "
"A 67 year old female patient was referred to the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of our hospital, presenting with a circumscribed tumour in the left parotid region. On palpation it had a pasty consistency, easily movable, with no signs of infection or skin alterations. No palpable adenopathy was found in the lymph node chains of the neck. There was no pain in the area of the tumour. No alterations were observed on intraoral examination. The time of evolution was 3 years. The patient had no other relevant systemic alterations.  A CT scan was requested, which showed that the tumour involved the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. There was no evidence of alterations in the surrounding tissues. Given the clinical picture, the presumptive diagnosis is a benign salivary gland tumour.  Under general anaesthesia and through an extraoral approach, the tumour was removed, performing a superficial lobectomy of the parotid gland with preservation of the facial nerve.  Pathological anatomy confirmed the diagnosis of benign myoepithelioma. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals typical markers for clear myoepithelial cells: actin, S- 100 protein and vimentin.8 The postoperative course is uneventful. Only a paresis of the peribuccal muscles is evident on the operated side, which completely resolves after 3 months. After one year of follow-up, no signs of recurrence were detected.   "
"58-year-old patient with a history of venous thrombosis in MMII. Rest of the patient was of no interest. She presented with an ulcerated lesion at the level of the left jugal mucosa, approximately 3 cm in diameter, compatible with squamous cell carcinoma. A 2 cm diameter lymphadenopathy was also palpable at cervical level I.  Surgery was performed and the tumour lesion was resected with a safety margin and unilateral functional cervical dissection. The defect was reconstructed using a medial brachial graft from the left arm. The pedicle of the flap was taken from the ACCS, which was anastomosed with the facial artery, and the thyrolinguinguofacial venous trunk (TVTLF), which was joined to one of the concomitant veins of the ACCS, as no blood refluxed through the basilic vein. The length of the pedicle was about 6 cm, the diameter of the artery 1.5 mm and the diameter of the vein 1 mm.  The intraoral defect was completely covered, providing sufficient volume, and the arm skin closure was performed directly without the need for a free graft.  The patient was discharged 10 days after the operation and the graft was found to be viable.   "
"We present a 30-year-old man, with no medical or surgical history of interest, who consulted for a left latero-cervical tumour of several months' evolution; the patient reported night sweats in recent months as the only noteworthy finding in the anamnesis. Examination revealed a tumour measuring approximately 5x5cm in diameter medial to the lower third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) with an elastic consistency, poorly defined, not adhered to deep planes or skin, whose size did not vary with postural changes, non-pulsatile, and with negative auscultation. A computerised tomography (CT)-guided puncture was requested, which was reported as lymph node cellularity with indeterminate changes that could not be cytologically typed, recommending a viral serology study. The CT scan with intravenous contrast showed a homogeneous, solid, well-defined mass measuring 5x7 cm, located in the left cervical vascular space, compressing the left internal jugular vein, behind the MCE, with moderate contrast uptake and some adjacent lymphadenopathy. There was no hyperenhancement suggestive of carotid glomus. The radiological differential diagnosis included lymphoproliferative process, neurogenic tumour or mesenchymal tumour.  Under general anaesthesia a left supraclavicular horizontal incision and section of the ECM muscle at this level was performed to obtain adequate exposure. A 5x7 cm tumour of congestive appearance was found, hard with intense peripheral vascularisation that made its dissection difficult; the tumour presented a plane of separation with the vascular space. The clinical appearance at the time of surgery impressed the authors as a vascular tumour.  Pathological examination of the specimen revealed a lymph node with preserved architecture and a marked increase in the number of lymphoid follicles and positivity for immunohistochemical markers (CD20+CD10+, bcl2-). Characteristically, the germinal centres showed hyaline material, some vessels and onion-layered arrangement of the lymphocyte crown.  The number of plasma cells (CD138) were in the normal range and showed no restriction for immunoglobulin light chains (kappa and lambda). The molecular study did not detect the presence of human herpes virus type 8 (HHV 8) by PCR. A thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed, which was normal. Complete blood tests, immunology and serology were normal. These findings represent the localised form of lymphoid angiofollicular hyperplasia or Castleman's disease, hyaline-vascular variant.   "
"A 33-year-old male patient was referred for consultation because he presented with a tumour in the basal mandibular region at the parasymphyseal level on the right side with several years of evolution and slow growth. His medical history included tuberous sclerosis and having undergone a kidney transplant after a nephrectomy for renal angiomyolipoma. Symptoms of the disease included Pringle's sebaceous adenoma of Pringle in the nasolabial region, retinal hamartomas in the fundus and fibrotic lesions in the posterior cervical region. Clinical examination revealed a hard lesion adhering to the mandible, approximately 2x2 cm in diameter, with mild pain on palpation. On the skin of the lateral cervical region and on the nape of the neck, multiple small excrescent lesions of dark colouring and fibrotic appearance were observed. Intraoral examination revealed gingival hyperplasia, which was attributed to chronic anticonvulsant treatment with hydantoin to prevent the epileptic seizures typical of his underlying syndrome, which the patient had previously suffered.  Panoramic X-ray showed increased bone density at the mandibular level in the parasymphyseal region, and CT scan showed chondroid bone excrescence and erosion of the mandibular cortex at the right parasymphyseal level with no soft tissue mass component. The radiographic differential diagnosis included: ameloblastoma, odontogenic myxoma, aneurysmal cyst, chondromyxoid fibroma, central haemangioma or eosinophilic granuloma.  Under general anaesthesia and using a cutaneous approach, the hard round lesion was excised with a safety margin in the mandible. In addition, the cervical fibroids were excised in the same surgical procedure using a CO2 laser. The day after the operation the patient was discharged from the hospital. He has subsequently been seen in outpatient clinics without any signs or symptoms of recurrence of the mandibular lesion for three years.  Pathological examination of the excised mandibular bone lesion revealed a lesion consisting of a small number of fibroblasts and a stroma with a large amount of hyalinised collagen. Bone spicules were observed within the lesion without osteoid rim indicative of bone infiltration of the tumour. The lesion had spindle-shaped cells with elongated, uniform nuclei with few mitoses and no atypia, which made it benign. The study concluded that it was a desmoplastic fibroma.   "
"Male patient, aged 37 years, who came to the clinic with a right paramandibular nodule, 6 years old, which has increased in size in the last year. He reported that the lesion appeared after the exodontia of a lower molar.46 On examination, the patient presented a nodule 1.5 cm in diameter, at the bottom of the vestibule, at the level of 45 and theoretical 46. The lesion was mobile, well demarcated, elastic in consistency and painful on palpation. The overlying mucosa was normal. An orthopantomography was performed and no mandibular pathology was observed. Resection of the lesion was performed under local anaesthesia, previously locating the exit of the mentonian nerve to preserve it.1  Macroscopically, the lesion was a well-demarcated, whitish, nodular lesion measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm in size. Microscopically the lesion consisted of uniform spindle-shaped cells with poorly defined cytoplasmic boundaries, oval or round nuclei, without mitosis or nuclear pleomorphism. The cells were randomly arranged interspersed with collagen fibres and isolated blood vessels. There were no areas of necrosis, no haemangiopericytoid pattern. At the periphery the lesion was delimited by a connective tissue border.  Immunohistochemically the lesion cells were: strongly positive for: vimentin, CD34 and bcl2 ; weakly positive for: factor XIIIa and muscle specific actin (1A4); and negative for: S-100 protein, cytokeratins (CAM 5,2;AE1-3), desmin and muscle actin (HHF35).  The postoperative course was uneventful, and one year after surgery there are no signs of local or regional recurrence.   "
"Patient EJO, brunette, female, 23 years old, was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service of the Piracicaba Dental School (FOP/UNICAMP) for removal of a lesion in the lingual region of the lower anterior teeth. The patient had a clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. Physical examination revealed facial asymmetry and hundreds of skin nodules all over the body, including the face and neck. Café-au-lait spots were present on the trunk and upper limbs.  Intraoral examination revealed malocclusion, diastemas, absent teeth and a neurofibromatous mass in the region of the lower alveolar ridge, lingually to the incisors. The lesion was firm and painless to palpation, of normal mucosal colouring, non-ulcerated, with a sessile base and about 2.5 cm in extension. Due to its size and its relationship with the teeth, it did not allow adequate hygiene of the region, favouring the accumulation of calculus. The tongue also showed an increase in volume, with the presence of a neurofibromatous lesion with diffuse limits.  On radiographic examination, the presence of retained element 23 was observed, as well as right mandibular hypoplasia.  Surgical excision was performed for the neurofibromatous lesion in the lower anterior region. The lesion in the lingual region was not approached surgically due to the fact that it did not present any functional or aesthetic compromise for the patient. The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis was confirmed by anatomopathological analysis.  The patient is now six months post-operative follow-up, with no complaints and no apparent sign of recurrence of the lesion. The patient is currently under periodontal treatment, with significant improvement of the local supporting tissue conditions.   "
"Female patient who at birth presented with a bluish spot in the right naso-orbital region, which grew rapidly over the following month. When she was seen by us at the age of 6 months, she presented a 4 cm pedunculated mass, which involved the nasoorbital sulcus and nasal dorsum, the child had acquired the habit of looking at the lesion and presented strabismus.  Five days later, treatment was started with injections of Betamethasone 4 mg intralesional, and after four sessions at four-week intervals, the fibrous haemangioma was excised using a supraciliary incision.  The postoperative evolution was satisfactory.   "
"44-year-old male admitted for facial trauma. Radiographic examination revealed a large radiolucent lesion and a displaced angle fracture.  Enucleation of the lesion, extraction of the causative tooth roots and reduction-osteosynthesis of the fracture with intraosseous wire and mini-plate with monocortical screws were performed.  Histological examination of the enucleated material revealed an inflammatory root cyst. Bone healing was observed radiographically two months later.   "
"We present a 24 year old female patient who consulted the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the San José Hospital Complex in October 2006, referred from the Dermatology Department of the same centre with a diagnosis of SMR due to an increase in the volume of the lower lip which had not responded to treatment with intralesional and oral corticoids. The patient reports that the enlargement of the lower lip dates back to 2004, which was biopsied in the same year and histopathologically diagnosed as a GCS associated with MDS. Initial treatment consisted of intralesional infiltrations performed in the dermatology department with betamethasone 4 mg and prednisone 0.5 mg without positive results. In her medical history, she reported a history of morbid epilepsy under treatment, mild mental retardation, hypothyroidism, insulin resistance and allergy to iodine. The drugs he uses regularly are Levothyroxine 100 mg 1 tablet/day, Carbamazepine 200 mg 1.5 tablets/day, Metformin 850 mg 1 tablet/day. Physical examination revealed a large increase in the volume of the lower lip, which was everted, associated with a depapillated tongue and the presence of transverse furrows on the dorsum of the tongue compatible with a fissured tongue, as well as a discrete macroglossia.  Treatment consisted of 3 intralesional infiltrations of 1 ml of Kenacort®-A 40 mg (Triamcinolone acetonide) diluted in 1 ml of 2% lidocaine in the lower lip to control post-infiltration pain, at one-week intervals. The patient was monitored for three months, where a marked reduction in the size of the lower lip was observed, but still without achieving an aesthetic size, so a fourth infiltration was performed without improvement. Then a lower lip reduction cheiloplasty was scheduled under general anaesthesia to improve the aesthetics of the patient's lip, with good results that were controlled at one month postoperatively.   "
"We present a case of an 18-year-old male referred to Hospital 12 de Octubre by SAMUR, after suffering a bull horn injury to the left cervicofacial region during the running of the bulls in San Sebastián de Los Reyes in August 2005. He was immediately transferred to the operating theatre, where the correct orotracheal intubation, which had been carried out in situ by the medical staff in the bullring, was confirmed. The absence of respiratory and cardiovascular alterations was verified, as well as a stable haemodynamic situation. Then, under general anaesthesia, a regular tracheotomy and cannulation of the corresponding central and peripheral airways were performed. Subsequently, an initial and diagnostic examination was carried out, where an incised and anfractuous wound was observed from the upper left supraclavicular region to the ipsilateral labial commissure. A fracture of the right mandibular body, comminuted fracture of the left mandibular angle, dental avulsion of the incisal sector of the upper jaw, as well as severe laceration of the lingual musculature and floor of the mouth were observed. In addition, an exposure of the left jugulo-carotid bundle was observed, which was found to be completely intact. Interdental suturing was performed at the fracture sites and adjacent soft tissue in order to provisionally restore the anatomy, and the patient was transferred to the Radiology Department for a diagnostic craniofacial CT scan in order to rule out the existence of associated central nervous system and cervical lesions. Subsequently, once in the operating theatre, direct laryngoscopy was performed to exclude the presence of laryngo-oesophageal lesions. The entire oral cavity and affected tissues are meticulously washed with a surgical brush and antiseptic solution. Tetanus vaccine and gamma globulin are administered, and systemic intravenous treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and metronidazole is started.  After correct exposure of the fracture sites at the level of the right mandibular body and left mandibular angle, favoured by the characteristics of the wound itself, reduction and osteosynthesis is performed using 2.4 Synthes® mandibular reconstruction plates, given the presence of comminution in one of them and the high potential for infection of the surgical site. The remaining root debris in the upper incisal sector was exodonticated and the corresponding bone regularisation was carried out. Suture and anatomical restoration of the cervical musculature, floor of the mouth and tongue. Microsurgical anastomosis of the right mentonian and left lingual nerves. The skin and oral mucosa are sutured. The patient was subsequently transferred to the ICU-Polytrauma Department where he remained for 36 hours, presenting no neurological or systemic complications during this time. After referral to the ward, antibiotic treatment was continued for 10 days, and the wound was treated daily with antiseptic solution, both intraoral and cutaneous. There was no evidence of infectious pathology in this area, and the patient progressed favourably, being discharged on the eleventh day.   "
"A 64-year-old male patient attended the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias with squamous cell carcinoma affecting the lingual border, the lateral oropharyngeal wall, the tonsillar area and the left soft hemipalate. There were also large metastatic adenopathies in the vascular axes and in the submaxillary regions on both sides of the neck. In a first surgical step, the tumour was resected, a classic left cervical radical resection and a reconstruction of the defect with a microvascularised anterolateral fasciocutaneous microfasciocutaneous thigh flap. Three weeks later, a classic right radical cervical resection was performed. Due to the magnitude of the surgery and in anticipation of possible postoperative complications, an elective rule tracheotomy was also performed in the first operation, using the Björk flap as a means of opening the trachea. The tracheostomy was maintained until several days after the second operation, with spontaneous closure of the tracheostoma occurring after decannulation of the patient and release of the tracheal flap attachment to the skin.  Subsequently, the patient received complementary radiotherapy treatment of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and cervical lymph node levels I to VI. A control cervicothoracic CT scan, requested 4 months after surgery, revealed the existence of a small mass compatible with a neoplastic process in the right middle lobe of the lung, for which reason he was referred to the Pneumology Department. A bronchoscopy was then performed, in which a suture thread was observed in the lumen of the trachea, black in colour, about 2.5 cm long, inserted at one end into the anterior tracheal wall. An attempt was made to remove it, but when it was found to be firmly fixed, and to avoid possible tears in the tracheal wall, it was decided not to do so. Finally, the lung mass turned out to be inflammatory in nature and resolved spontaneously.  In relation to the tracheal suture thread, the only symptomatology reported by the patient was an occasional foreign body sensation, without causing cough or dyspnoea.   "
"Male patient, aged 10 years, referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Piñero Hospital to be assessed for an increase in volume in the right mandibular angle region of two weeks' evolution; with no medical history of interest. The swelling was not painful on palpation and there was no report of paraesthesia.  Intraoral examination revealed bulging of the vestibular and lingual table of the lower jaw. The teeth were healthy and without mobility; the mucosa appeared normal.  Radiographically, a radiolucent, unilocular lesion with sclerotic borders was observed. Root resorption of tooth 37 was also evident.  The biopsy result was fibroma ossificans, so the lesion was scheduled for enucleation under general anaesthesia. The pathological anatomy confirmed the result of ossifying fibroma.  The last clinical-radiographic control was performed at eight months, with a good evolution and radiographic evidence of bone neoformation and increased thickness of the mandibular basal. The patient remains under follow-up to rule out recurrence of the tumour...   "
"We present the clinical case of a 25-year-old male patient who came for consultation due to repeated episodes of pain and inflammation around the lower left semi-included third molar. The medical history does not include any medical history of interest, the patient does not take any daily medication except antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs for the current problem, he is not a smoker and is in perfect health.  After the clinical examination, we requested an orthopantomography as the first diagnostic test. In it we can see how the wisdom tooth in question (38) is in close contact with the NDI canal, detecting radiological signs determined as clear indicators of high risk of injury to the nerve during extraction manoeuvres. Thus, curvatures are observed in the roots, darkening around the apices (mesial root) and an effacement of the upper cortex of the canal in contact with the distal root. Although the orthopantomography showed a fairly clear image, we decided to request a CT scan in order to plan the case correctly before deciding on the therapeutic procedure. In the CT images we verified that the contact between the wisdom tooth and the NDI is real and that, therefore, the risk of damaging it during extraction is high.  In this situation, we inform the patient of the possibility of performing a coronectomy or partial extraction of the symptomatic third molar. With this technique we aim to eliminate the clinical symptoms caused by pericoronaritis, as we achieve a direct closure of the wound and the roots are included, preserving the integrity of the NDI. The patient was informed of the possibility of an infectious complication of pulpal cause, which would force us to re-enter to complete the extraction. Re-entry would also be necessary if, in the long term, root migration were to occur, and the roots were to return to generate clinical pericoronaritis due to exposure. Only, if this occurs, the relationship of the roots to the NDI would probably no longer be as clear, and the extraction, therefore, not as compromised. After obtaining the patient's informed consent, we decided to perform the coronectomy using the following surgical technique: Administration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Bayonet incision and lifting of a full-thickness flap similar to the one used for complete extraction of a wisdom tooth. Cutting of the crown with a fissure drill from the buccal table, following an angulation of approximately 45°. This section is complete so as not to exert force on the roots with the drills, which requires being very careful when approaching the lingual table so as not to injure the lingual nerve. Subsequently, further tooth tissue is removed, either with the same fissure bur or with a round bur from above. The latter is slightly easier than with the fissure drill. In this way, the section is at least 3 mm below the bone ridges. The aim is to allow the bone to regenerate over the roots and to enclose them in the jaw. The exposed root surface should not be treated. Finally, the remains of the follicle are removed, without mobilising the roots, the remaining tooth and the wound is sutured with loose stitches that are removed in one or two weeks. Radiological check-ups should be carried out at one month, six months and annually.  All these steps were carried out in our case, and the patient has not presented any complications in one year after the intervention.   "
"Male patient, 17 years old, referred to the Maxillofacial Surgery Service of the University of Talca, for presenting a lesion at the level of the right mandibular angle, revealed in a cervical lateral teleradiography control, following a car accident. The patient reported no personal or family history. History of smoking, alcohol and drugs were negative, as were any medication intake or drug allergies. The general physical examination was not compromised. No aesthetic or functional alterations were observed on extraoral clinical examination. Intraoral palpation revealed a slight increase in volume in the posterior area of the mandibular vestibule.  In the conventional radiological study an extensive unilocular image of mixed density was observed, with radiopaque predominance, surrounded by a radiolucent band with net corticalised limits located in the area of tooth 48, partially overprojected in the roots of tooth 47 with bulging of the bony slabs and with rejection of tooth 48 towards the distal and cephalic region. The mandibular canal was displaced towards the basilar edge in the segment corresponding to the mandibular body and rejected distally in the ascending branch.  The study was complemented with a computed axial tomography scan showing a hyperdense lesion, with clear and corticalised limits, with widening of the bony tables. Its dimensions were: antero-posterior 25.9 mm, vestibulo-palatine 21 mm and 28.3 mm in greatest cephalo-caudal diameter.  The acquisition of the images was processed with Dentascan® software, obtaining axial, panorex and transversal reconstructions of the area of interest, which confirmed the proximity to the mandibular canal, as well as the involvement of both tables.  The differential diagnosis for this case was immature complex odontoma, ameloblastic fibroodontoma, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour and calcifying epithelial odontogenic cyst. After the radiological study, an incisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia, which included both soft and hard tissues, showing calcified dentine-type tissue, with areas of minor calcification and lax fibrous connective tissue that resembled the stellate reticulum of the dental organ. The periphery showed fibrous connective tissue and some small areas showing epithelium of odontogenic origin with the presence of peripheral cylindrical cells of the ameloblast type. The sample was irregular and showed no denticle structure. Accordingly, the histological diagnosis was a lesion compatible with an odontoma in formation with the presence of ameloblastic changes. Enucleation of the lesion was performed under general anaesthesia, using an extraoral approach at the level of the right mandibular angle to facilitate modelling and subsequent placement of a rigid osteosynthesis. In this way the affected area was accessed, finding a very diminished vestibular table, which was removed to make way for the exposure and complete elimination of the lesion, concluding with a curettage of the surgical bed. The remnant of healthy bone tissue was very poor, so the placement of a 2.4 reconstruction plate at the level of the mandibular angle and body was planned to provide greater strength and prevent a pathological fracture. Immediate grafting was not planned due to the possibility of recurrence.  Histopathological examination of the operative specimen revealed a greater amount of ameloblastic tissue and a diagnosis of ameloblastic fibroodontoma was made.  Healing went smoothly. Although this lesion has a low recurrence rate, the patient is monitored regularly and there have been no signs of recurrence to date.   "
"The third patient is a 25-month-old male, who came directly to the emergency maxillofacial surgery department referred by his local paediatrician, presenting with inability to close his mouth and drooling, as well as refusal of breakfast. The previous day, while playing in the swimming pool, the child had fallen and hit his nose, resulting in erosion of the nasal root. Based on the clinical presentation and this history, the child was diagnosed with traumatic dislocation of the TMJ. In our examination we noted pain in the preauricular region on both sides that worsened when closing the mouth. However, complete closure was possible without reduction manoeuvres, and occlusion was good. Otoscopy was very painful, the ""swallow sign"" was positive, and the CAE was swollen with mild scaling and discharge. X-rays of both TMJs were normal. The patient was referred to the ENT department where, after appropriate treatment, the condition resolved.   "
"A healthy 24-year-old woman presented with gingival bleeding in the right upper right posterior teeth during the last 6 months. The patient also reported episodes of mild pain and a gradual deviation of the teeth. There were no signs of fever or pus. A general systemic examination of the patient revealed no abnormalities. Local examination revealed a diffuse swelling of 1 x 3 cm in the alveolus corresponding to the upper right molars. The swelling was more prominent on the vestibular side. The surface appeared rough and erythematous. There were no visible pulsations in the lesion. The aforementioned teeth were deviated towards the palate. On palpation, the swelling showed a hard consistency. The three affected teeth did not respond to heat, cold or electrical pulp stimulation. Orthopantomography was inconclusive. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a soft tissue mass in the right maxillary alveolus, without bone erosion. Radiological examinations and routine haematological examinations, including coagulation tests, revealed no abnormalities.  Based on clinical, radiological and CT findings, a provisional diagnosis of giant cell lesion was made, and an incisional biopsy of the vestibular gingiva was performed. Marginally increased intraoperative bleeding was evident, but was attributed to inflammation. The pathology report of the specimen revealed fibrovascular connective tissue with aggregates of numerous dilated endothelial capillaries and venules suggestive of AVM. After consultation with an interventional radiologist, resection of the lesion was decided and performed under general anaesthesia. The single specimen included vestibular and palatal gingivae, alveoli, and the affected teeth. Haemostasis was achieved and the defect was closed by first intention by advancement of the palate and buccal mucosa. The perioperative period and recovery was uneventful and comfortable for the patient. Pathological analysis of the specimen was very similar to that of the incisional biopsy and revealed numerous arterioles and venules interspersed between the bony trabeculae, extending into the gingiva suggesting arterio-venous malformation.  The patient was followed up for a period of 1 year without recurrence.   "
"The patient was a 62-year-old man, partially edentulous and not wearing prostheses, smoker since the age of 12 (20 cigarettes a day). He consulted for a painful tumour measuring 5 x 3 cm on the tongue, which had developed over a month, and a weight loss of approximately 6 kg in two months. The tumour was located on the right free edge, extending towards the base of the tongue. There was an ulcer unrelated to chronic dental or prosthetic trauma.  A biopsy of the ulcerated area was taken and histology suggested a differential diagnosis between pseudosarcomatous carcinoma and epithelioid-fusocellular sarcoma. One month later, pulmonary metastases were seen on chest X-ray, osteolytic images in the dorsal-lumbar spine and two subcutaneous nodules on the dorsum. Biopsy of a dorsal nodule showed the same diagnosis as in the tongue. No treatment was given and the patient was admitted to palliative care and died 6 months later. Pathological anatomy: tongue biopsy (haematoxylin-eosin): infiltrating and ulcerated epithelioid and fusocellular neoplastic proliferation, with a high mitotic index. Differential diagnosis between pseudosarcomatous carcinoma and epithelioid and spindle cell sarcoma.  Immunohistochemistry: negative pankeratin (AE1-AE3), positive vimentin, negative desmin (positive in non-tumour muscle), negative CD34 and positive actin in spindle cell component (positive intrinsic control in vessels and non-invaded muscle). Immunohistochemical diagnosis: infiltrating leiomyosarcoma of the tongue.   "
"A 30 year old man, who after suffering an assault was taken to the emergency department of the Hospital Universitario La Paz due to multiple incised wounds to the face, neck, scalp and left hand. On arrival he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for marked hypothermia, Glasgow 10, severe metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia and acute renal failure, requiring mechanical ventilation for 24 hours. After resolution of the acute organic symptoms and primary suturing of the wounds, the patient was transferred to the ward after 48 hours, and was discharged from hospital one week after admission.  Six days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department for pain and swelling in the left preauricular region, underlying the surgical scar of one of the facial wounds. Symptoms included tinnitus and physical examination revealed limited oral opening and a left preauricular lump measuring 2 × 2 cm, soft and pulsatile on palpation and inspection. Auscultation of the mass revealed a murmur synchronous with arterial systolic flow. A parotid ultrasound was performed, showing an image compatible with a high-flow left intraparotid arteriovenous fistula. The cervicofacial and cervical computed tomography (CT) scan showed an image suggestive of a vascular pocket measuring 36 × 25 × 24 cm, located behind the left mandibular vertical branch, between the deep and superficial lobe of the parotid gland, at the level of the retromandibular vein. There is a probable arterial afferent image coming from branches of the external carotid artery, with venous drainage towards the external jugular vein.  With a view to a diagnosis of certainty, an angiography was carried out showing a vascular lesion whose fundamental afferent is the proximal portion of the internal maxillary artery and whose venous drainage is directed superiorly towards the pterygoid plexus and descending towards the external jugular vein. There is also retrograde flow from the facial artery into the pouch. Treatment is carried out on the spot by embolisation via microcatheterisation of the internal maxillary artery and occlusion with a 3 × 8 mm platinum coil. However, the final angiographic control showed late retrograde filling from the left facial artery.  The patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up, with evident clinical improvement. Angio-CT revealed occlusion of the internal maxillary artery with closure and thrombosis of the fistulous pocket. Outpatient follow-up at 1 and 6 months showed no complications or recurrence.   "
"A 33 year old male patient, who was referred from another hospital centre for presenting a large right hemimandibular tumour, 6 months old, which had experienced progressive growth, and which he reported after exodontia of a molar in the fourth quadrant, with no mention of significant pain at that level. Physical examination and orthopantomography revealed a bone-dependent tumour 5-6 cm in diameter, with involvement of both bony cortices, extending from the region of the second premolar to the middle of the right mandibular ramus, with involvement of the ipsilateral internal pterygoid muscle.  A facial computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mandibular tumour lesion measuring 5.5 × 4.8 × 3 cm, destroying the internal mandibular cortex, displacing the musculature and structures of the base of the tongue, and involving most of the right mandibular body and ramus, with preservation of the condyle. A diagnostic biopsy was performed, with the result of a myxoid lesion with a reactive lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory component, with positivity for vimentin, CD138, Kappa, Lambda and partial positivity for actin. Immunohistochemistry showed negativity for S-100, CD31 and CD68. The diagnosis was mandibular odontogenic myxoma.  Under general anaesthesia and nasotracheal intubation, surgical excision of the lesion with margins was performed using a combined intraoral and extraoral approach, with segmental haemimandibulectomy from the canine region to the ipsilateral mandibular ramus and coronoid process, preserving the mandibular condyle. The patient had a serrated contralateral hemimandible. Primary reconstruction was performed using a microvascularised free fibula graft. The maximum thickness of the fibula was 14 mm. The flap was preformed in situ, with carving of the new hemimandible using a reconstruction bar modelled on the original mandible, and subsequent osteotomy of the peroneal bone and fixation with miniplates. Vascular anastomosis was performed between the right peroneal and facial arteries, and between the concomitant right peroneal veins and right thyrolinguofacial venous trunk. The histological study of the specimen was reported as a mandibular odontogenic myxoma without involvement of the surgical edges. The postoperative period was uneventful. One year after the operation, on observing a height discrepancy of 17 mm between the fibula and the alveolar ridge of the contralateral hemimandible, it was decided to perform vertical osteogenic distraction of the fibula by placing an intraoral alveolar distractor.  Distractor placement was performed under general anaesthesia. The fibula graft was exposed through an incision in the vestibular oral mucosa, after which a subperiosteal dissection was performed to adequately visualise the underlying bone, taking extreme care to preserve the periosteum of the lingual aspect of the fibula. The intraoral alveolar distractor (MODUS ARS 1.5; Medartis®, Basel, Switzerland) was placed on the vestibular surface of the fibula to correctly design the osteotomies. The osteotomies were performed on the vestibular surface of the fibula, using an oscillating saw, with saline irrigation. A trapezoidal bone segment was obtained, with the lingual periosteum remaining intact. The alveolar distractor was fixed with screws on both sides of the horizontal osteotomy. Once the perfect functioning of the distractor had been checked, the distractor was placed in its starting position, so that both bone fragments were in perfect apposition. This is essential to initiate bone formation from the position of maximum contact between fragments and to achieve adequate post-osteotomy haemostasis. The vestibular incision was closed leaving part of the distractor through the incision to facilitate activation of the distractor.  Distractor activation was not performed during the latency period (10 days). After this, activation was performed at a rate of 0.5 mm per day. Serial orthopantomographic controls (obtained weekly) showed vertical distraction of the peroneal bone and the formation of bony trabeculae at the interface at the end of stabilisation. 17 mm of bone was obtained in 34 days, so that the fibula graft reached the same level as the contralateral alveolar ridge, with optimal correction of the initial height discrepancy between the two.  The consolidation period lasted three months, during which the distractor was maintained in its initial fixation site. Orthopantomography at three months confirmed excellent ossification between the basilar and the distracted fragment. Subsequently, in a second operation, the distractor was removed using the same intraoral approach. The quality of the newly formed bone, ascertained macroscopically, was excellent. In the same operation, three 3.75 × 15 mm threaded titanium implants (Mozo-Grau®) were placed in the distracted area. Good primary stability was achieved in all implants. The postoperative period was uneventful. Prosthetic rehabilitation, using an implant-supported prosthesis, was successfully completed after three months of osseointegration. The results obtained, both aesthetic and functional, were satisfactory for both the patient and the surgeon after 18 months of follow-up.   "
"Female patient, aged 19 years, who consulted for recurrent mild pain in the left hemimandibula, associated with paraesthesia in the aforementioned area, especially in the lower lip. He also described slight pain on chewing in the molars and premolars on the affected side. Physical examination revealed a slight facial asymmetry due to an increase in volume located in the most posterior area of the mandibular body and right ascending ramus. The enlargement is painless. Intrabuccally, a bulging external bone table is observed in the area of the second molar. A similar situation, but with expansion of both tables, is detected on palpation of the mandibular ascending ramus. Third molar clinically absent. With the diagnostic hypothesis of an odontogenic mandibular cyst or odontogenic tumour, an imaging study is requested prior to biopsy. The panoramic X-ray revealed an extensive radiolucent lesion with clear limits, uniloculated and involving the entire ascending mandibular branch. Associated with the lesion, the third molar is observed in a low position and in distoversion.  An incisional biopsy was scheduled during which, according to the clinical characteristics of the lesion, a decompression cannula was installed. The histopathological report revealed an Ackermann type IIIa unicystic ameloblastoma with intramural growth9.  After 10 months of clinical and radiographic follow-up, with the presence of a decompression cannula whose length is gradually reduced, the ameloblastic cystic lesion is almost completely reduced, so enucleation and curettage surgery of the residual cavity is performed, in addition to exodontia of the third molar involved 15.   "
"A 57-year-old woman whose medical history included a history of paraganglioma of the carotid body in the patient's sister, who was treated with surgical resection of the lesion. She came to the department with an increase in cervical volume on the left side anterior to the sternocleidomastoid of 5 years' evolution, slow growth, firm to palpation, mobile in the anteroposterior direction, with recent odynophagia and dysphonia. Computed tomography with contrast medium showed a hyperdense, well-defined lobulated image measuring 29.7 × 33.3 mm, located in the carotid bifurcation, with no apparent airway involvement. Angiography shows a typical ""lyre"" image, in which the ovoid lesion shows a homogeneous hyperenhancement of contrast, as well as an opening of the carotid bifurcation.  Based on the clinical and imaging findings, a diagnosis of carotid body paraganglioma is made. Due to the size of the lesion, selective embolisation was performed with polidocanol foam and, 48 hours later, under general anaesthesia and orotracheal intubation, surgical resection of the lesion was performed with a laterocervical approach anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, dissection by planes until the lesion was located, which was completely resected with subadventitial dissection; collateral carotid branches were ligated for haemostatic purposes, maintaining the integrity of the carotid arteries. The specimen obtained is sent for histopathological study, in which the presence of clusters or nests of oval cells with uniform hyperchromatic nuclei surrounded by vascular stroma is observed, forming the Zellballen pattern, the classic pattern of carotid body paraganglioma.   "
"56 year old patient, treated for cancer of the left lingual border by left glossectomy and left cervical lymphadenectomy, pT4N2bM0 positive surgical border, receiving concurrent adjuvant radiochemotherapy (cisplatin, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy) (66Gy tumour bed, 54Gy cervical chains) which ended in March 2006. In November 2007 (18 months) we observed a right laterocervical mass, level II, 4cm and 29mm in CT. Negative extension study. Pathological anatomy: carcinoma. Considered unresectable by the Head and Neck Tumour Committee (CTCC) due to doubts about infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, we decided on chemotherapy (cisplatin six cycles) and re-evaluation. In May 2008 cervical MRI showed partial remission (24mm). After CTCC assessment, we decided to perform a right modified functional cervical lymphadenectomy with resection of the jugular vein and spinal nerve encompassed by the tumour mass, followed by interstitial HDRBT (June 2008), placing the vectors in the surgical procedure. After total excision, the tumour bed and organs at risk (carotid artery, brachial plexus) were identified by the surgeon and oncologist. We used a single-plane implant with five plastic tubes (separated by 1cm to minimise the risk of vascular toxicity) and Nucletron® comfort buttons (catheter-skin fixation). We used helical CT slices (5mm) for therapeutic simulation. Pathology showed metastasis of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in 4 of 7 resected nodes, all with extranodal infiltration. The HDRBT planning volume was defined as 5mm from the centre of the catheter. The total dose of 34Gy (10 fractions of 3.4Gy, 2 per day [6 hours apart], five consecutive days), was started five days after surgery.  As a multidisciplinary follow-up we evaluated: functional status, physical examination, toxicity, TSH value, and cervical CT scan. In February 2011, the patient is free of disease, in good general condition, without pain, as chronic toxicity: grade I soft tissue fibrosis (National Cancer Institute criteria [version 3.0]).   "
"This is a 5-year-old female patient referred to our department with a diagnosis of oronasal fistula. Her history included bilateral cheiloplasty and palatoplasty of the soft palate at the age of 6 months and palatoplasty of the hard palate at the age of 4 years, with the latter procedure presenting a dehiscence (oronasal fistula) that caused rhinophonia and nasal reflux of food. On intraoral examination we observed an oronasal fistula at the junction of the primary and secondary palate on the left side measuring approximately 12mm x 25mm.  It was planned to close the fistula with an anteriorly based lingual flap due to the size of the defect. Technique Under general anaesthesia with nasotracheal intubation the palatal defect is contoured by taking a tissue margin of approximately 8mm. The mucosa overlying and surrounding the fistula is unfolded and its edges are faced to create a nasal floor. An aluminium template is made with the dimensions of the fistula, from which a slightly larger flap is designed. The lateral edges of the tongue are sutured to a horseshoe-shaped acrylic plate, which is intended to stabilise and support the tongue to facilitate taking the flap.  Once the tongue flap has been obtained, the primary closure of the lingual cruciate area is performed. The flap is then positioned over the oronasal fistula and suturing is started from back to front.  Twenty-one days after surgery a perfusion test was performed, no evidence of ischaemia was observed and the pedicle was removed under local anaesthesia. Satisfactory closure of the fistula was achieved, a small dehiscence occurred in the immediate postoperative period, which closed spontaneously after three months.   "
"A 22 year old male patient came to the maxillofacial surgery department of the Hospital San José referred by his dentist for a painless increase in volume in relation to the body and left mandibular branch of undetermined evolution. The patient had no previous morbid or surgical history. On extraoral examination there was an increase in volume involving the body and left mandibular ramus that had not previously been detected by the patient. There was no skin involvement and no adenopathy. There was also no associated sensory involvement and the mandibular functional examination was normal.  On intraoral examination the patient presented partial edentulousness due to the absence of the lower left canine and molars, and an increase in volume with a dented surface involving the body and ramus on the same side. The overlying mucosa had whitish areas, was painless to palpation and hard in consistency.  A panoramic radiograph was requested, showing a well-defined, bilocular, radio-opaque, mixed lesion, extending from the root of the lower right lateral incisor to the middle of the left mandibular ramus, with a diameter of 12cm in its largest diameter and 4cm in its smallest diameter. Included in the lesion were the tooth germs of the left lower canine, first and second molar. The anterior border of the ramus, alveolar ridge and basilar border were expanded.  A CT scan was requested which showed thinning of the bony cortices, mainly of the vestibular cortical bone. Based on this, a stereolithographic model was requested to plan the definitive surgery.  An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histopathological examination stained with haematoxylin-eosin showed a lesion consisting mainly of fibroblastic stroma with variable cellularity, containing multiple calcified structures of different sizes and irregular distribution. The histopathological diagnosis was FO.  With this diagnosis, definitive surgery was planned. A 2.4 reconstruction plate was modelled on the stereolithographic model and extended at the level of the basilar border from the right lower first molar to the upper area of the left mandibular ramus. The mandible was exposed via a cervical approach and the mandibular segment involved was resected en bloc, taking the tumour borders as the limits. Subsequently, mandibular reconstruction was performed using a microvascularised fibula graft, which was adapted to the reconstruction plate and sectioned into three parts to facilitate its adaptation to the plate.  Post-operative management of the patient involved antibiotic therapy and conventional analgesia together with revulsives and a soft diet. The latter was prolonged for one month. After one year postoperatively, the patient underwent oral rehabilitation with the placement of osseointegrated implants on which a hybrid prosthesis was made.  The patient continues to have regular clinical and radiographic check-ups. Currently, after 5 years, he is in very good condition.   "
"An 18-year-old woman referred to the Emergency Department of the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre from another hospital centre after suffering a traffic accident with direct craniofacial impact. The patient reported no personal history of interest and on admission had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15. Physical examination revealed significant oedema and bilateral periorbital haematoma with crepitus, right otorrhagia and rhinorrhoea from the left nostril. When assessed by the ophthalmology department, no decrease in visual acuity, diplopia or alterations in extrinsic ocular movements were observed, although left macular oedema was observed. There were no initial alterations of cranial nerves except for paraesthesia in the V1 territory. Palpation revealed significant decalation in the left supraorbital rim. With the diagnosis of suspected skull base fracture with associated cerebrospinal fluid fistula, a craniofacial CAT scan was requested, showing a comminuted left frontobasal fracture-split with associated involvement of the ipsilateral temporal scale and pneumocephalus. Fracture of the right cranialmost portion of the cranial aspect of the right cerebellum lateral to the superior semicircular ducts. Fracture without displacement of the anterior wall of the right carotid canal. At the level of the brain there were multiple contusive haemorrhagic foci mainly located in both frontal lobes, parieto-temporal endocranial bone fragments and minimal subarachnoid haemorrhage in the tentorium with right occipital epidural haematoma, probably due to contrecoup injury.  After diagnostic confirmation of cerebrospinal fluid fistula (beta-2 transferrin test +) associated with complex frontobasal fracture, it was decided, together with the Neurosurgery Department, to carry out surgical treatment: Left bicoronal and subcranial approach with excision of impacted frontobasal fragments. Repair of basal dural tears by means of duraplasty and fibrin adhesive after aspiration of the contused left frontal base. Obliteration of the frontal sinus after obturation of the duct with calotte bone chip and DBX (demineralised bone matrix) and curettage of the sinus mucosa. Reconstruction of the left orbital roof with titanium mesh and bone fragments fixed to it. Reduction and osteosynthesis of frontotemporal fractures and left supraorbital rim. Temporal muscle pectomy.  The patient was assessed at regular post-surgical check-ups without presenting any symptoms. Control imaging tests showed postoperative changes and complete frontal sinus obliteration.  Eighteen months after the operation, the patient started again with occasional unilateral rhinorrhoea from the right nostril. After ordering imaging tests (high-resolution CT and MRI), a post-traumatic sphenoidal meningocele was observed with a paramedial cranial base defect measuring 1.5cm by 1.5cm. It was associated with a cystic cavity of right frontobasal cerebrospinal fluid.  Given the characteristics of the lesion, transnasal endoscopic treatment was decided. Opening of the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus with visualisation of the herniated meningocele. Intracranial dissection and monopolar coagulation until progressive intracranial reduction. The defect is delimited at the cranial base and fibrin adhesive is applied. The sphenoid sinus was obliterated with abdominal fat. Lumbar drainage was maintained until the 5th postoperative day and the anterior nasal packing was removed the same day without evidence of intranasal fluid leakage.  Postoperatively, control MRI scans were performed, showing the absence of a previous meningocele and adequate obliteration of the cranial defect with autogenous fat. The patient is currently in the third postoperative year after the last operation without recurrence of meningocele or clinical signs of cerebrospinal fluid fistula.   "
"The patient is a 61-year-old male. His pathological history included being allergic to clarithromycin, suffering from Barrett's oesophagus, essential tremor and chronic iron deficiency anaemia. His mother died after a renal carcinoma. He underwent surgery in 2005 for renal carcinoma (p T3b Nx M1). At the time of diagnosis, he had bilateral adrenal metastases, metastatic lesions in the lungs and doubtful liver. He underwent right nephrectomy and left adrenalectomy. Subsequently, he started a clinical trial with interferon and bevacizumab with partial response of the metastatic lesions. In 2010, following the appearance of a parotid tumour, an ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration puncture (FNA) was performed, compatible with metastasis of renal carcinoma. To study the extent of the lesion, a cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, which showed a tumour at the right parotid level involving both the superficial and deep lobes, measuring 2.6*3.4*3.4cm and compatible with a metastatic tumour.  The positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed a hypermetabolic lesion at the right parotid level compatible with a metastatic process. After the study by our tumour committee, it was decided that the treatment of choice was radical parotidectomy due to the involvement of both parotid lobes.  The pathological anatomy revealed a mass with a morphological and immunohistochemical pattern compatible with metastasis of renal clear cell carcinoma. For this characterisation it was necessary to use cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin and cd10. In addition, the involvement of deep vascular and nerve structures was revealed and it was decided to perform postoperative radiotherapy.  Postoperatively, the patient experienced an episode of seroma at the level of the surgical wound, which resolved without complications. The postoperative evolution was favourable and the patient was discharged from the hospital, and the wounds were monitored in outpatient clinics.   "
"A four year old male child was referred from the diagnostic service of the Universidad Mayor to the Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna Paediatric Hospital for evaluation of an increase in volume in the right mandibular area, asymptomatic and of undetermined evolution. The mother reported that she had not noticed the increase in volume until the time of referral, and that the child never complained of pain or functional impotence. The patient had no relevant morbid or surgical history. Extraoral examination revealed an enlargement involving the body and right mandibular ramus, firm and painless on palpation, with no skin involvement. There were no adenopathies. There was also no associated sensory involvement and the mandibular functional examination was normal.  On intraoral examination, the patient had complete primary dentition and a large increase in volume involving the body and the right side ramus, the mucosa covering it was undamaged, painless on palpation and hard in consistency.  In the panoramic Cone Beam view, an extensive well-defined unilocular radiolucent lesion could be observed, with variable content of radiopacities similar to dental structures, extending from the distal root of the second temporal molar to the upper area of the right mandibular ramus, equivalent to 45mm in the mesiodistal direction, 30mm in the vestibulo-lingual direction and 35mm in the cephalo-caudal direction. The lesion produced displacement towards the basilar edge of the first permanent molar germ, while the second permanent molar was not observed. The anterior border of the ramus, the alveolar ridge and the basilar border were involved. In the coronal section, the expansion of the vestibular bone table and the inferior displacement of the lower dental canal were particularly visible.  An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histopathological examination with haematoxylin-eosin staining showed fibrous connective tissue with areas of dental tissue with varying degrees of calcification similar to dentine or dentinoid tissue, all in relation to odontogenic epithelium. In addition, areas similar to dental papilla were observed with epithelial proliferation arranged in cords and islets with periphery similar to ameloblasts, and towards the centre tissue reminiscent of stellate reticulum. The histopathological diagnosis was FOA.  With this diagnosis, definitive surgery was planned. Under general anaesthesia, the approach was performed at the level of the anterior border of the right mandibular ramus. Bone exposure showed a significant expansion of the mandibular vestibular bone table, over which an osteotomy was performed to allow access and subsequent complete enucleation, followed by conditioning of the cavity and suturing with Vycril 4.0.  Postoperative management of the patient involved antibiotic therapy and conventional analgesia in conjunction with revulsives and a soft diet. The latter was prolonged for one month. The patient is maintained with periodic controls in the immediate and late postoperative period and, currently, after one year postoperatively, he is in very good condition.   "
"A 28-year-old male patient, with no past history of interest, consulted for a progressive, non-painful left malar tumour that had been noticed for 15 days. He had no history of local trauma. On examination, a hard lesion was palpable on the inferoexternal rim of the left orbit, approximately 1 cm in diameter, with no apparent pulsatility.  Doppler ultrasound reported an expansive, polylobulated malar lesion with partial calcification and no vascular signal. Orbital computed tomography (CT) detected a rounded, well-defined medullary lesion with trabeculated internal structure and cortical expansion without infiltration or periosteal reaction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) described an expansive malar osteolytic malar lesion measuring 16x10x13mm, with well-defined sclerotic margins, absence of perilesional soft tissue infiltration and intense contrast uptake.  Given the presumptive diagnosis of a low-flow vascular lesion, and given the progressive characteristics of the lesion, it was decided to excise the lesion under general anaesthesia. The lesion was exposed through a left subciliary approach with tail enlargement towards the malar and dissection in planes. After a box osteotomy including a peripheral safety margin of 0.5cm, the defect was reconstructed with chin graft and arched titanium plate. The intercortical gaps were filled with cancellous bone obtained from the donor site. Postoperative radiological controls showed an anatomical reconstruction with good bone consolidation.  Pathological examination revealed dilated vascular spaces lined with endothelium without atypia, concluding an ""intraosseous haemangioma"". However, the immunohistochemical study was negative for GLUT-1. Therefore, we consider that the correct clinical and immunohistochemical diagnosis is intraosseous venous malformation. After 5 months of follow-up, the patient is completely asymptomatic, with an excellent cosmetic result.   "
"An 86-year-old patient consulted the maxillofacial surgery team at the San José Hospital Complex for an asymptomatic increase in volume, of undetermined evolution in the anterior mandibular area. The patient had a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes controlled by conventional medical treatment. She had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Physical examination revealed a large increase in volume in the anterior mandibular region of firm consistency and painful on palpation. The skin and mucosa overlying the lesion were normal, with no associated lymphadenopathy. There was also no associated motor or sensory neurological involvement. A computed tomography (CT) scan was requested, where axial images showed a hypodense lesion with a multilocular appearance extending from the region corresponding to the right canine area to the contralateral region corresponding to the left first molar, which generated bulging, thinning and perforation of bone tables. An incisional biopsy was scheduled and a drainage tube was installed in order to decompress the lesion.  Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed a cystic cavity lined by a parakeratinised poly-stratified epithelium with a basal stratum basale of ciliated cells with a hyperchromatic nucleus arranged in a palisade. Based on these findings the lesion was diagnosed as a keratocystic odontogenic tumour.  With this diagnosis it was decided to continue with decompressive therapy and to monitor the patient. After 2 weeks, the patient presented pain and functional impotence that increased to the point of preventing her from eating 2 months after the drain had been installed. With this evolution, a new CT scan was requested in which it was confirmed that the decompressive therapy was not fulfilling its objective, as an increase in tissue involvement was observed as a result of the lesion, in relation to the previous conditions, presenting clear destruction of both vestibular and lingual bone tables. Three weeks after the decompression procedure, and taking into account the new clinical and radiographic findings, excision of the lesion was performed plus curettage and application of Carnoy's solution for 30 seconds on the operative site. The underlying bone defect was reconstructed using a mandibular reconstruction plate. The surgical specimen was sent for histopathological study, which reported the presence of a cystic membrane with anaplastic epithelial tissue, with loss of epithelial stratification, cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, loss of the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, prominent nucleoli, among others. The neoplastic proliferation showed an infiltrative pattern towards the underlying connective tissue. In other areas of the sample, nests and islets of epithelial proliferation were observed in the thickness of the cystic wall, which showed the same anaplastic characteristics. Based on these histopathological findings, a diagnosis of moderately differentiated intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma was made. In view of this diagnosis, imaging tests were requested, including chest X-ray, total bone scan and bone scintigraphy, which ruled out metastases and/or possible primary tumours. The patient was referred for oncological treatment and died of pneumonia.   "
"This is a 52 year old male patient with a medical history of controlled arterial hypertension and stage V chronic renal disease of 6 years of evolution on haemodialysis 3 times a week who started his illness when he presented with odontalgia of the lower incisors, dysphagia, odynophagia, increased volume in the painful submandibular region and local hyperthermia, for which reason the patient attended the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of the Hospital General del Oeste ""Dr. José Gregorio Hernández"" (CBMH). José Gregorio Hernández"" (CBMF-HGO); 24 hours later, given the patient's systemic clinical conditions and presenting leukocytosis of 27,800 U/mm3, with neutrophilia of 82.4% and creatinine at 7.5 mg/dl, it was decided to admit him. Physical examination revealed icteric sclerae, a severe increase in volume with a predominance of the submental and bilateral submandibular region and a mouth opening limited to approximately 15 mm. Intraoral examination revealed partial maxillomandibular edentulism, generalised chronic periodontal disease with grade IV mobility of 3.1 and 4.1, presence of local irritants, halitosis, severe enlargement of the floor of the mouth and bilateral sublingual space with glossoptosis.  In conjunction with the Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine departments, empirical treatment was started with crystalline sodium penicillin 4,000,000 IU every 6 hours intravenously and aztreonam 1 g intravenously on a daily basis. A CT scan showed an isodense image in the parapharyngeal space compatible with an increase in volume, showing a decrease in the airway lumen in the cervical region and corroborating the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina.  After 10 days of treatment, the evolution was torpid. A re-evaluation by the infectious diseases department indicated 1 g intravenous vancomycin, which caused significant clinical improvement in the patient. After systemic stabilisation of the patient, an exodontia of 3.1 and 4.1 and surgical drainage of the sublingual, submandibular and submentonian spaces was performed through a bilateral submentonian and submandibular incision inferior to the mandibular basal, which allowed access, communication and the establishment of 3 passive drains with a Nellaton probe for 3 daily washes of saline solution for 3 weeks. The patient's evolution after surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy replacement showed a decrease in volume increase and a stabilisation of the respiratory rate. The last recorded haematology revealed a white series of 8,600 U/mm3, at the expense of neutrophils (78%), haemoglobin of 9.5 g/dl, haematocrit of 32.7% and creatinine of 6.8 mg/dl. All these conditions led to medical discharge.   "
"A 63 year old woman with no previous history of importance consulted for a mass of soft consistency measuring 3 cm in diameter in the left parotid region with a history of 4 months, accompanied by peripheral paralysis of the cervical branch of the facial nerve with deviation of the homolateral labial commissure. The tumour, mobile and painless, was easily revealed by bimanual palpation and was predominantly intraoral. The patient had no significant palpable lymph nodes in the neck and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Consultation with neurology ruled out the possibility of central facial palsy by means of a CT scan of the brain. Soft tissue ultrasound was reported as a solid heterogeneous mass with soft tissue density in the parotid region and no adenomegalic rank nodes in the neck. Fine needle aspiration puncture under ultrasound control was reported as negative with haematic material on 2 occasions. It was then decided to perform a freezing biopsy under general anaesthesia with an intraoral approach whereby the tumour was accessible and protruded under the oral mucosa next to the ostium of the Stenon's duct. After incising the mucosa, a lax, wine-red tumour with a vascular appearance was found, which was removed without difficulty through the same incision, and its continuity with the parotid tissue of normal characteristics was verified. Freeze biopsy revealed a lesion compatible with a benign vascular tumour. The mucosa was closed with separate stitches of polyglycolic acid and the procedure was terminated. The evolution was favourable with hospital discharge at 24 h and complete recovery of facial paralysis at 10 d postoperatively. There is no evidence of disease after 5 years of follow-up. The deferred histological report was parotid capillary haemangioma....   "
"A 30-year-old male suffered an accident while loading a speargun at home. The emergency services were notified. After protocol ""A, B, C"" the clinical examination of the patient showed only a penetrating wound at the level of the submandibular region. The approximate size of the spear was 80 cm long and 1 cm in diameter with an intracranial trajectory of about 15 cm. The firefighters carefully cut the harpoon to facilitate the transfer of the patient to hospital. The patient was haemodynamically stable, alert and oriented (Glasgow 15), with no neurological deficit and no active bleeding. There were blood clots in the left ear canal. There was no cerebrospinal fluid leaking from the entry wound or the external auditory canal. The lateral skull X-ray showed the trajectory, direction and the existence of a beard mechanism in the harpoon. An emergency CT scan was performed which showed the direction of the arrow. The entry orifice was in the left submaxillary region and penetrated to the carotid siphon of the left temporal bone crest, passing very close to the petrosal sinus. The flap of the harpoon was located at the level of the left mandibular condyle on its inner side. Under general anaesthesia and nasotracheal intubation, the patient was placed in a supine and neutral head position. The position of the harpoon, adjacent to the left mandibular condyle, made oral opening difficult. Despite this, access was made intraorally at the level of the left tonsillar pillar. A 4 cm incision was made. Through this approach, the harpoon was exposed at the level of the flipper mechanism. Subsequently, the barba mechanism of the harpoon was inactivated by means of a steel wire ligature.  Finally, under intraoral control, the harpoon was extracted in the opposite direction to its entry.  No cerebrospinal fluid was observed to leak from the entry wound or from the intraoral access. The intraoral wound was sutured with 3/0 vicryl, the subcutaneous with 4/0 vicryl and the submandibular wound with 4/0 prolene. Immediately after the operation, a follow-up CT scan was performed, showing only a small pneumocephalus.  The patient was kept under observation for 24 hours without showing neurological focality. Subsequently, he went to the ward and was discharged on postoperative day 3 without any neurological disorder. No complications were reported. One month later, an audiometry was performed which revealed a conductive hearing loss of 60% in the left ear. The patient is now living a normal life and is only waiting for a hearing aid.   "
"A 24-year-old woman, with reactive serology for HIV since 5 years ago, without antiretroviral treatment or clinical controls, who reported starting approximately one month ago with pain in the lower right maxillary region. He consulted a dentistry department where tumefaction was found in the right lower maxillary region, at the level of the third lower molar. Treatment with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was indicated. Two weeks later, she consulted again with no improvement in her symptoms, reporting increased pain and swelling. The symptoms were interpreted as a dental phlegmon and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and corticosteroids were prescribed. One week before hospitalisation, and due to the increase in size of the described tumour, surgical drainage was performed, obtaining haematic material. Analgesics were prescribed and the same antibiotic regimen was maintained. Five days after this procedure she was admitted to our hospital. As epidemiological antecedents, she reported addiction to inhalation cocaine, marijuana and smoking. On admission she was lucid, afebrile, oriented in time and space; the physical examination revealed the existence of a tumour formation in the right lower maxillary region extending to the submental area, measuring approximately 10 × 10 cm, red-violet in colour, indurated, painful on pressure, which prevented the closure of the mouth, chewing, swallowing and speech. It involved the gum, including dental pieces, the peribuccal soft tissues and the right lower jaw. Homolateral submandibular adenomegaly was palpable, indurated, painless, adherent to skin and deep planes. The rest of the physical examination showed no alterations of clinical relevance. Chest X-ray was normal. The admission laboratory showed: Ht: 35%, WBC: 7. 200/mm3 (N: 70%, E: 0.3%, B: 1.6%, M: 5.6%, L: 21%); ESR: 21 mm 1 hour; TGO: 41U/l, TGP: 31 U/l, FAL: 153 U/l, glycaemia: 138 mg/dl, urea: 27 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.56 mg/dl, Na+: 136 mEq/l, K+: 4.1 mEq/l, prothrombin concentration 98%, KPTT: 30.6"", pregnancy test: negative, VRDL: non-reactive. Serologies for Chagas and hepatitis B and C virus were negative and for toxoplasmosis: IgM: negative and IgG: positive 1/64. CD4+ T-cell count was 235 cells/ml (16.3%), CD8: 872/mm3 (60.5%) and HIV viral load was 154,263 copies/ml (log10 4.74).  An abdominal ultrasound revealed mild heterogeneous splenomegaly; the rest of the patient had no abnormalities. An excisional biopsy was performed for diagnostic purposes; histopathological examination of the material obtained showed a proliferation of atypical, medium to large lymphoid cells with regular nuclei, lax chromatin, presence of nucleoli attached to the cell membrane and amphophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitoses and apoptosis phenomena were also observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for CD45, CD3, CD20, CD10 and Bcl-6 in the neoplastic cells, and negativity for CD138, MUM-1 and Bcl-2. The Ki67 cell proliferation index was 99%. Microbiological studies of the biopsy material were negative for BAAR, fungi and common germs. The definitive histopathological diagnosis was primary LB of the oral cavity. Bone marrow biopsy showed no infiltration by atypical lymphoid cells. Gram, Grocott and Ziehl Neelsen stains were negative.  The patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy based on the EPOCH-R schedule (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, with rituximab and intrathecal methotrexate). Episodes of neutropenia were treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After treatment, complete disappearance of the gum lesion was observed. Four years later, the patient is asymptomatic, with no evidence of neoplastic disease, undetectable viral load and CD4 362 cells/ml.   "
"This is a 38 year old male patient, who reports limitation of oral opening which he noticed started at the age of 18 and has been progressing. Totally asymptomatic, he already has difficulty feeding. In addition, he suffers from various intraoral carious foci that the dentists he has visited have declared impossible to treat due to the reduced oral opening. The patient refers to multiple treatments with different specialists trying to improve this oral opening, with physical therapies and jaw exercises, which have been totally ineffective. At the time of the first examination, the patient had a maximum oral opening of 16 mm, which did not change when forced, and the patient had a panoramic X-ray and computerised tomography in which an evident elongation of the coronoid processes above the level of the zygomatic arch was observed. Once diagnosed as HPC, it was decided to perform the bilateral coronoidectomy by means of an intraoral approach, with a maximum oral opening of 40 mm during the trans-operative period.  Three days after surgery, physical therapy was started with oral opening exercises and support with tongue depressors, with good progress during the first week (maximum oral opening of 21 mm). Subsequently, his oral opening became critical (6 mm of maximum oral opening). It was decided to use functional orthopaedic appliances, with the use of the Spring-Bite, with an interval of 10 minutes, 4 to 5 times a day, obtaining an oral opening of 30 mm 30 days after its use. The use of the appliance was continued for 6 months.   "
"A 47-year-old woman came to our department 3 months after discovering a tumour in the left preauricular region. The patient reported that the lesion was of sudden onset and progressive growth. She complained of pain in the temporal, cervical and left periocular region. Her medical history included only essential arterial hypertension and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with no other relevant systemic alterations. Physical examination revealed a nodule approximately 1.5 cm in diameter in the left preauricular region. On palpation, the tumour was soft, mobile and slightly tender to the touch. The maximum oral opening is 45 mm and there is joint popping in both joints. The rest of the head and neck examination is unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal an image suggestive of a cystic lesion measuring 1.8 × 1.7 × 1.4 cm adjacent to the upper border of the parotid gland. The MRI shows a left TMJ-dependent pedicle, with the position of the articular meniscus and displacement of the mandibular condyle with open and closed mouth being normal.  A fine needle aspiration puncture was performed, which was reported as a sample consisting entirely of proteinaceous material and histiocytes, compatible with a cystic lesion. In view of the findings obtained, surgical treatment was carried out using a preauricular approach, identifying the trunk of the facial nerve and its respective branches. After dissection of the facial nerve, it was decided to perform a superficial parotidectomy of the upper portion as multiple adhesions to the lesion were found, isolating the synovial cyst above the frontal branch of the facial nerve. Subsequently, the pedicle that communicates the cyst with the temporomandibular joint was visualised, proceeding to its ligation and subsequent resection. The wound was sutured in planes.  The surgical specimen obtained was fixed with 10% formalin. Histological sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin revealed a multilocular cystic lesion. To establish with certainty the presence of synoviocytes in the cyst lining, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed their existence.  During the outpatient follow-up of the patient after 9 months of evolution, she has shown no postoperative complications or signs of recurrence.   "
"We present a 43-year-old man who came to our department for assessment of a left frontal tumour of 6 months' evolution without previous trauma at that level. The patient reported no pain in the tumour, only a feeling of heaviness and left fronto-occipital headache. Physical examination revealed a tumour measuring 1 cm in diameter with minimal perilesional erythema. On palpation it appeared as a hard mass, not adherent to the bone plane without alteration of the frontal branch of the facial nerve. He also reported a similar nodule in the right costal region. A CT scan and an ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture-aspiration (FNAUS) of the costal tumour were requested. The CT scan showed a mass of approximately 0.7 cm at the level of the left frontal region, well defined, which did not invade adjacent tissues and showed no bone destruction. FNAUS of the right costal region was reported as a lipoma.  It was decided to perform a biopsy-excision of the tumour under local anaesthesia. Intraoperatively a lesion firmly attached to the fascia of the frontalis muscle and the pericranium was observed. A subperiosteal dissection including frontalis muscle and pericranium was performed, no erosion of the underlying frontal bone was observed. Closure of the surgical defect was straightforward and simple. The postoperative period was uneventful and there was no recurrence after 18 months of postoperative follow-up. The anatomopathological study describes macroscopically an irregular white-pardusc nodular fragment measuring 0.9 × 0.7 × 0.4 cm. Microscopy revealed a connective tissue with a circumscribed, poorly demarcated nodular lesion composed of a proliferation of oval-fusiform elements arranged in a lax matrix with a swirling-storiform pattern together with osteoclastic giant cells, some extravasated red blood cells and a scattered mononuclear inflammatory component. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD68 antibody and vimentin protein in the giant cells and with less intensity in the oval cells. Negative for S-100 protein. Positivity for Ki 67 antibody, representing a proliferative index of less than 5%.  The study concludes with the diagnosis of benign neoplasia of mesenchymal origin type FN.   "
"An 80-year-old woman comes to the clinic with a painless left submandibular tumour that has been present for 2 months and has experienced progressive growth and increased consistency. It is not accompanied by constitutional syndrome. The patient's only history was renal lithiasis and arterial hypertension. Physical examination revealed a left submandibular mass approximately 4 cm in diameter, hard in consistency, adherent to deep planes, which did not cause pain on palpation. There were no alterations in cervical mobility or facial expression. In the intraoral examination there was no inflammation of the floor of the mouth or Wharton's canal. An ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration puncture-fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed, which was reported as a carcinoma of undetermined nature. An MRI scan was requested and the report was compatible with a heterogeneous left submaxillary mass, with internal necrosis, measuring 3 × 4 × 3 cm, which had imprinted on the floor of the mouth, with no conclusive signs of infiltration of the supra-hyoid musculature and which respected the mandibular bone cortex.  With the diagnosis of malignant tumour of the submaxillary gland, a type III left functional cervical dissection was performed, including the hypoglossal nerve, the digastric muscle and the marginal branch of the left facial nerve, with a reaming of the left mandibular medial aspect. Histological analysis of the specimen shows a neoplastic proliferation with infiltrative borders, growing in nests and cords, consisting of cells with large cytoplasm and plasmacytoid and epithelioid morphology. The nuclei are atypical with moderate pleomorphism, prominent nucleolus and 11 mitoses/10 high magnification fields. The cells are arranged within a hyalinised stroma. Extensive areas of necrosis and foci of squamous differentiation are seen. No ductal structures are seen. The immunohistochemical study shows that the neoplastic cells are positive for CKAE1/AE3, actin, calponin, p63, S-100 protein and GFAP, and negative for CEA. The proliferative index (Ki67) is 25%. The tumour is completely resected and the distance to the nearest resection margin is less than 1 mm. The lymph nodes are negative for malignancy. This report is compatible with the diagnosis of myoepithelial carcinoma of the submaxillary gland pT3-N0, MX. Following a multidisciplinary consensus, postoperative radiotherapy was decided. The total dose of radiotherapy received was 60 Gy, divided into 30 sessions. The patient is being followed up in outpatient clinics 3 years after the surgery and, after serial control MRI and CT scans, no signs of tumour recurrence or metastasis were observed.   "
"We present the case of a 24-year-old male referred to the maxillofacial surgery department of our institution for evaluation of cleft lip and palate. The patient had no history of interest except for unspecified surgery for his underlying disease years before, and with secondary malar hypoplasia. On physical examination the patient had dysmorphia of the nasal pyramid. Cephalometric analysis and imaging studies including multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) confirmed the presence of maxillary hypoplasia. A 2-phase surgical management was planned based on clinical and radiological findings. In the first phase a LeFort type 1 osteotomy with placement of internal maxillary distractors was performed. After correction of the maxillomandibular relationship, a second phase would probably include extraction of teeth and rehabilitation with dental implants. The first phase of treatment was carried out without immediate surgical complications. The patient presented 27 days later to the emergency department for epistaxis for which bilateral anterior packing and admission were indicated. It was decided to perform MDCT after intravenous contrast injection (IVC) for vascular study of the facial mass, which revealed a pseudoaneurysm of approximately 8 × 9 × 8 mm (anteroposterior, transverse and craniocaudal diameter) in the right pterygo-palatine fossa with probable origin in the ipsilateral internal maxillary artery.  During admission, the patient presented significant episodes of oral and nasal bleeding with important haemodynamic consequences, for which a subsequent tamponade with Foley catheters was performed. One day later, selective arteriography of the right external carotid artery was performed with therapeutic intent, which confirmed the presence of the pseudoaneurysm and its dependence on the internal maxillary artery. It was decided to perform embolisation in the same intervention with 50% cyanoacrylate glue. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the maxillofacial surgery ward. As there were no new bleeding episodes or haemodynamic alterations, 6 days after embolisation, the patient was discharged.   "
"A 9 year old female patient who from the age of 3 years presented with protrusion at the level of the nasal root. In the last year, prior to admission, an increase in this deformity was detected, which caused cosmetic alterations and anxiety with schooling problems. Physical examination revealed only a frontal bulge over the nasal root, with no pain on palpation or other relevant pathological findings.  Cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed deformity of the frontal sinus, with no occupation of the sinus; sinus walls of normal thickness. No intracranial lesions were found. There was also a concomitant right parietal lesion compatible with fibrous dysplasia.  The hormonal study revealed levels within the normal range for her age. The patient underwent surgery and a coronal incision was made, exposing the frontal bone and nasal root and revealing a bulging of the frontal sinus. Multifragmentation and remodelling of the anterior wall of the sinus was performed, preserving the mucosa, using an ultrasonic scalpel. The bone defect was reconstructed with resorbable mesh (polylactic and polyglycolic acids). In addition, the parietal lesion was resected and remodelled, replacing the internal cortex.  The patient had no postoperative complications and had a favourable evolution. The subsequent cosmetic result was optimal. The histological study of the parietal lesion was non-pathological. The patient was followed up clinically for only one year, due to moving home for family reasons, and there was no evidence of recurrence or discomfort in the region of the operation.  "
"This is a 54 year old female patient diagnosed with partial edentulism of both arches and severe Seibert class III alveolar atrophy1 in the edentulous premaxilla region.  The treatment plan consisted of the placement of 2 autoclaved hydrogel beads for tissue expansion of the premaxilla and a subsequent en bloc bone allograft at the same site. Two weeks after placement of the hydrogel beads, they were exposed and removed, with placement of Biograft® brand allograft blocks, preformed trans-surgically by means of stereolithography. Wound closure was achieved without tension and without the need to unload the flap or make incisions to release tension from the periosteum.  Once the period of osseointegration of the block had been completed (approximately 6 months), the dental implants were placed, initially planned in a suitable position, with very good bone and soft tissue for their rehabilitation.  "
"A 72-year-old man, with no medical history of interest and under treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs since 2011 for chronic cervical pain, attended the emergency department reporting significant gait disturbance and progressive loss of strength in the limbs over the last 6 months accompanied by dysphagia for solids and moderate dyspnoeic symptoms. Physical examination revealed spastic left hemiparesis, generalised hyperreflexia, positive Romberg's sign and ataxia. MRI showed soft tissue thickening around the odontoid process leading to severe stenosis of the spinal canal, especially in the left half, with involvement of the bulbomedullary junction and voluminous anterior syndesmotic proliferations at C2-C6, predominantly at C4-C5, which deformed and partially obliterated the airway.  With a diagnosis of Forestier's disease, the patient initially underwent transoral surgery, with resection of the anterior arch of the atlas and the odontoid process without neurological improvement, so an external anterolateral cervical approach and resection of the anterior osteophytic projections of C3-C4-C5 were performed. Postoperative evolution showed progressive clinical improvement of dysphagia and hemiparesis with absence of respiratory symptoms.   "
"A 49-year-old man with a personal history of multiple paragangliomas. In 2005 he underwent surgery for right jugular paraganglioma by infratemporal approach with good postoperative evolution. In 2014, surgical treatment was decided for a right vagal paraganglioma due to tumour progression, and the paraganglioma was excised laterocervically. Postoperatively, the patient presented right facial paralysis grade II on the House-Brackmann scale, cophosis and paralysis of the right cranial nerves IX, X, XI and XII. In successive check-ups at the clinic, the patient presented dysphagia, dysphonia, and also reported very intense pain in the infra- and preauricular region that appeared with the start of chewing at all meals, and which progressively subsided. It was decided to inject hyaluronic acid into the right vocal cord, botulinum toxin into the right cricopharyngeus muscle and, given the suspicion of PMS, it was decided to inject botulinum toxin into the right parotid region. Five units were infiltrated in 12 points for a total of 60 units. After 15 days the patient noticed a notable improvement in his dysphonia and complete disappearance of the pain.   "
"Female patient, aged 23 years, non-smoker, with no relevant medical or surgical history or known drug allergies. She came to the clinic because of an increase in the volume of the lower vestibular gum, adjacent to the left mental orifice, of 2 months' evolution, with active growth. It was not related to traumatic causes. Clinical examination revealed a nodule 0.5 cm in diameter, of fibroelastic consistency on palpation, similar in colour to normal mucosa, partially adherent to deep planes and painless. On radiological examination, no particularities were observed in the area of the lesion.  Under local anaesthesia, an excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. Pathological examination revealed a proliferation of spindle cells arranged in short swirling fascicles, with abundant vascular structures of myxomatous appearance, isolated collagen deposits and foci of lymphocytic infiltrate with extravasated red blood cells. Immunohistochemical studies were also performed and were positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin and negative for alk-protein 1, beta catenin, CD 34, desmin, S-100. Ki67 expression was 5-6% of labelled nuclei. This picture corresponds to the diagnosis of nodular fasciitis. The patient was followed up for 18 months and no recurrence was observed.   "
"A 13 year old boy referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department from the Paediatrics Department for 4 days of asymptomatic swelling of the right cheek. He reported no other symptoms and no weight loss. Physical examination revealed a solid, elliptical mass between the body of the malar bone and the anterosuperior part of the right maxillary bone. There was a boundary between the lesion and the surrounding muscle and it did not infiltrate the skin. Intraoral examination revealed a firm, mobile and painless mass in the gingiva at the bottom of the vestibule of the right upper hemiarch. No other findings were found on examination of the head and neck. A biopsy was performed with intraoral access. Histologically, the mass consisted mostly of a compact proliferation of small cells. At higher magnification these cells consisted of round, uniform nuclei, revealing granular chromatin with peripheral condensation, as well as scanty, slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. The stroma was sparse with occasional fibrous tissue tracts. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for CD-99.  Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the presence of a well-demarcated, encapsulated solid tumour measuring approximately 24 × 13 mm located anterior to the right maxillary sinus, with anterior displacement of the zygomatic musculature. The lesion did not show infiltration of neighbouring structures and showed intense gadolinium enhancement after gadolinium administration, suggesting high cellularity of the lesion. No underlying bone changes or significant adenopathic growths were identified.  Prior to treatment, distant metastases were ruled out by biopsy and bone marrow aspiration, in addition to a full-body PET-CT scan. Treatment for ESS was administered following the Euro-EWING 99 protocol. The control MRI showed disappearance of the lesion, although with persistent thickening involving the affected facial musculature (inferior aspect of the orbicularis oculi and levator labii superioris), together with minimal enhancement after contrast administration. Surgical treatment of the remaining lesion was then performed, with extensive resection of the affected facial musculature and soft tissue. The maxillary bone plane was approached, without resection, as no tumour infiltration was observed either clinically or radiographically. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day in good general condition with no postoperative complications. Histological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed absence of malignant cells and negative margins. The control MRI findings were described as postoperative changes from the baseline study, with no criteria for underlying tumour recurrence or recurrence.   "
"A 70-year-old woman, whose personal history included a breast cancer operation 14 years earlier, came to the emergency department of another hospital because of severe pain in the lower lip accompanied by swelling and oedema in the lip, chin and submandibular area that had awakened her suddenly at night. She was initially treated with iv corticosteroids and analgesia, and referred home. Four days later, the patient came to the emergency department of our hospital describing that the lesion had become ""blackish and yellowish"". The lesion was not painful and there was no fever or other accompanying symptoms. On questioning, the patient reported having recently seen spiders in her home. This was in the context of an epidemic of bites by the Loxosceles reclusa spider in the same geographical area. In the previous 15 days, 7 cases of upper and lower limb bites had been diagnosed in the emergency department. Examination revealed a single lesion of about 2 cm, necrotic in appearance and well demarcated, occupying the lateral third of the skin, vermilion and commissure of the left lower hemilabium, surrounded by a white and purplish halo. Intraorally, a pale mucosal lesion with signs of necrosis and fibrinous exudate was observed in continuity and did not dislodge on scraping. Laboratory tests were ordered, a biopsy was taken and treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid by mouth was started. The infectious diseases department was consulted on suspicion of a spider bite. The differential diagnosis was made with necrotic cutaneous-mucosal lesions, such as cellulitis, vasculitis, diabetic ulcers, vascular insufficiency, drug reactions, thermal or chemical burns, infectious or traumatic, all of which were ruled out. After 7 days, the necrotic tissue was debrided under local anaesthesia. The suggestive clinical and epidemiological context, together with the laboratory and pathological anatomy results and the differential diagnosis, led to the probable diagnosis. At 2 months, given the low aesthetic and functional impact of the scar defect, lip reconstruction was not necessary.   "
"A 34-year-old woman, 18 weeks pregnant, attended the emergency department because during an episode of hyperemesis gravidarum with projectile vomiting she suddenly presented with right supraorbital swelling with ocular proptosis and visual alterations of the right eye. The patient had no personal history of interest, was not taking any regular medication and had not previously suffered any trauma. Ophthalmological examination revealed exophthalmos with hypophthalmos of the right eye, right mydriasis of 7 mm with decreased pupillary reactivity, limited supraduction and supraversion with diplopia, myodesopsia and painful upper eyelid oedema on palpation. Fundus examination was normal with intraocular pressure of 24 mmHg. No oedema or vascular abnormalities were observed in the conjunctiva.  As the patient was pregnant, an urgent orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was requested and the findings were compatible with a diagnosis of right extraconal intraorbital right intraorbital haematoma. A blood test based on routine haemogram, biochemistry and coagulation showed no abnormalities that could have precipitated the picture. Given the clinical repercussions and the increasingly evident changes in the patient's vision, it was decided to perform urgent surgery to evacuate the haematoma and decompress the orbit under general anaesthesia. A right upper blepharoplasty approach was performed, dissecting the orbicularis oculi muscle and the periosteum, until reaching the orbital supero-external bony rim. When the periosteum was incised at the level of the orbital aspect of the frontal bone, blood and clots from the extraconal haematoma were released under pressure. After evacuation of the haematoma there were no bleeding spots from any vessels in the region. A fine Penrose drain was placed and treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum was started with pyridoxine 10 mg/8 h iv + thiamine 100 mg/24 h iv + metoclopramide 10 mg/8 h iv.  The patient evolved favourably after surgery, with mydriasis and visual alterations disappearing in the first postoperative hours, and the drainage was removed after 48 h. Currently, 3 months after surgery, the patient is asymptomatic and without sequelae.  "
"Female patient aged 8 years with left hemimandibular enlargement, 5 months of evolution, rapid growth, painful. Intraorally, expansion of the vestibular cortex with displacement of dental organs. Radiographically, lesion destroying part of the body and left mandibular ramus, but preserving condyle and coronoid process. Result of incisional biopsy, mandibular plexiform ameloblastoma. Taking into account the aggressive local clinical behaviour of the lesion, en bloc excision was performed. A reconstruction prosthesis was placed, preserving the condyle and coronoid process. Postoperative period was uneventful. Nerve (lower dentition) and motor structures were preserved. Good mouth opening, and adequate facial appearance. Three months after the initial surgery, bone matrix mixed with medullary aspirate was placed in the surgical bed in an attempt to stimulate bone growth in the surgical bed, observing adequate bone neoformation to date with acceptable dental occlusion. Good oral opening, facial aesthetics, as well as preservation of sensitivity and motor skills. Five years of control without complications.   "
"A 29-year-old woman diagnosed with multiple cavernomas in 1996, the year in which she underwent surgery following a frontal haemorrhage of a right frontal cavernous angioma, with evacuation of the haematoma and resection of the vascular lesion. In the same year, a small left protuberancial angioma of 3 mm in diameter was detected. The patient remained asymptomatic until January 2004, when she was admitted for headache and vomiting associated with haemihypoaesthesia with paraesthesia of the right hemibody and right hemiparesis 4/5. Examination revealed a vertical nystagmus, right hemiparesis 4/5 and right hemihypoaesthesia with sensory extinction. The cranial CT scan performed on admission showed a right posterior protruberancial haematoma of 20 mm in diameter, related to the known location of the cavernoma.  Brain MRI confirmed the presence of a protuberancial cavernous angioma with the presence of perilesional haemosiderin defining the growth and bleeding of the lesion, which deformed the IV ventricle in the rhomboid fossa at the level of the left facial colliculus without emerging into the ventricle or any other part of the surface of the brainstem.  Given the clinical and radiological progression of the lesion, it was decided to intervene surgically, using intraoperative monitoring consisting of stimulation of the surface of the rhomboid fossa, to determine the location of the nuclei of the left cranial nerves VII X and XII. Intraoperative auditory potentials were also performed. To stimulate the nuclei located in the rhomboid fossa, we used the NIM-Response® System (Medtronic, XOMED) nerve monitoring system, applying a monopolar stimulus at constant voltage with a rectangular monophasic pulse. The maximum intensity applied was 2 mA. The stimulus duration was 100 µseconds and the frequency was 10 Hz. Electromyographic reading was performed with electrodes placed 5 mm apart in a bipolar arrangement to cover the representative muscle area. Electrodes to monitor the facial nerve were placed on the orbicularis oculi muscles of the mouth and eye. To record the cranial nerve XII the electrodes were placed on the genioglossus muscle. The recording of the Xth pair was performed with vocal cord sensors located in the anaesthesia tube. The patient was placed in prone position and a suboccipital craniectomy and excision of the posterior arch of C1 was performed. After dural and arachnoid opening and under microscopic control, asymmetry was observed at the level of the left facial colliculus. After anatomical identification of nuclei X and XII, their functionality was confirmed by intraoperative stimulation with positive electromyographic response. The facial nucleus was located only by stimulation and was found to be very lateral, on the border between the angle of the rhomboid fossa and the middle cerebellar peduncle. The nucleus was probably displaced laterally due to the mass effect of the haematoma, which was not visible on the surface. A pial incision was made, the haematoma was located and evacuated, as well as the cavernoma causing the haematoma. At the end of the resection, the monitoring of the nuclei involved was repeated, obtaining electromyographic response in all of them, although the intensity of the facial, especially of the orbicularis oris of the lips, had decreased. The auditory potentials were maintained with the same response as in the preoperative period. Postoperatively, the patient presented transient X and XII paresis, which recovered completely after 48 hours and which we suspect was due to the block produced by the repeated electrical stimulus. She also presented an internuclear ophthalmoplegia with one-and-a-half syndrome, which has partially recovered, with a persistent nuclear paresis of the left VI pair, as well as a nuclear facial paresis which has progressively improved. No motor deficits were observed in the long pathways, although he is unstable when walking, although he can ambulate unaided, autonomously. The level of consciousness is good, with preserved higher cognitive functions.  "
"A 69 year old man consulted the emergency department reporting a progressive and unexplained decrease in strength in the right lower limb of about fifteen days' duration. He also presented with paraesthesia in the distal areas of both feet. She did not report back pain and the symptoms began after pain in the knee. There was no history of interest except for hypertension, which was treated and well controlled. Examination by the emergency physician revealed a step gait and a decrease in strength 4/5 for dorsiflexion of the right foot. He was diagnosed in the emergency department with possible neuropraxia of the right external popliteal sciatic nerve and was referred to the rehabilitation department, where, two months after the onset of the symptoms, he was referred to the neurosurgery department after observing an intramedullary lesion at the level of L1, rounded, ill-defined, 1x1 cm, with an isointense centre and hypointense periphery in T1, which after the administration of gadolinium enhanced in a diffuse manner and showed thickening of the diameter of the conus medullaris. As a first diagnosis, the possibility of a conus medullaris ependymoma was reported, without being able to rule out the possibility of an astrocytoma. There was no mention of any mass other than the one described above and no other process was evident on MRI. The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery department with hypoaesthesia in the tips of the toes of both feet, together with a decrease in distal strength of 2/5 in the right lower limb and 3/5 in the left lower limb. On admission, he retained sphincter control and the Karnofsky index was 70. Chest X-ray was reported as normal.  The patient underwent an osteoplastic laminotomy and total resection of a l x l cm mass, easily resectable and not very haemorrhagic. Histological examination showed the presence of a metastasis of clear cell carcinoma of probable renal origin. This diagnosis was confirmed by a thoracic-abdominal CT scan, which showed a giant renal mass (11 x 1 x 1 x 14 cm) and several abdominal and pulmonary metastases of less than 1 cm in size that were not evident on plain radiology. The patient recovered practically all of his paraparesis during his stay in the neurosurgery department. The control MRI study performed at 3 months showed no signs of recurrence. The patient evolved favourably, with no neurological symptoms, 14 months after the operation.   "
"The present case corresponds to a 30-year-old woman with no relevant personal history, who consulted for an initial picture of a pulsating right hemicranial headache of two months' duration which progressed to become holocranial. The headache had organic features and was resistant to conventional treatment (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans). In addition, it was accompanied by blurred vision, more pronounced in the left eye, two episodes of self-limited diplopia and occasional episodes of left eyelid ptosis. The neurological examination revealed an afferent pupillary defect in the left eye with a decrease in visual acuity of 0.1 and 0.25 in the right eye. The rest of the cranial nerves showed no alterations on examination. The hormonal study did not reveal any functional alterations. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scan showed a non-calcified cystic lesion eroding the sphenoid sinus and the lateral walls of the sella turcica. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain confirmed the existence of a 4 x 3 x 3 cm tumour in the region of the sphenoid sinus, which was destroying, eroding and expanding the walls of the sinus and the clivus itself. The lesion caused compression and cranial displacement of the pituitary gland and the chiasm. It was isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences, with fluid-liquid levels inside, septate appearance and peripheral enhancement on post-contrast sequences. In addition, there was sclerosis of the surrounding sphenoid bone.  Under general anaesthesia, a transsphenoidal sublabial approach was performed, partially resecting the lesion in its central part, with the intention of decompressing the optic chiasm. The anatomopathological analysis confirmed the presence of a benign tissue with a partially mineralised appearance, with the presence of osteoblasts and irregular trabeculae forming large venous lakes, compatible with an aneurysmal bone cyst. Post-surgical control MRI showed adequate decompression of the optic chiasm with residual lesion in both lateral regions and ethmoidal cells. The neuro-ophthalmological examination performed at three months confirmed that the patient's visual acuity was practically normal (O.D.: 1 and O.I.: 0.9).  "
"This is a 20-year-old male diagnosed in September 2003 with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who received intravenous induction chemotherapy and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy using PL. After applying various treatment regimens for 8 months, complete remission of the disease was not achieved. Four lumbar punctures for intrathecal chemoprophylaxis were performed during this period without complications. Repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses were normal on all occasions. Platelet counts prior to these punctures were 34,000, 118,000, 338,000 and 161,000 platelets/mm3 respectively. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were normal, and no platelet transfusion was performed prior to LP. In May 2004, the patient was readmitted to hospital for a new cycle of chemotherapy and subsequently scheduled for a bone marrow transplant. A new LP was performed without incident, but on this occasion several platelet concentrates had to be trans-fused beforehand as the patient had thrombocytopenia of 26,000/mm3. In the previous 2 months he had also required several transfusions due to a progressive tendency to thrombocytopenia (below 20,000/mm3). PT and APTT were normal. A few hours after the last LP, the patient required attention for isolated right sciatica. After about 48 hours, radicular pain was associated with loss of strength in both MMII, which rapidly evolved into bilateral paraparesis, with only partial motor strength (3/5) in flexion-extension of the feet. No sensory or sphincter disturbances were observed. An emergency dorsolumbar MRI was performed, which showed an image suggestive of ventral intradural extraparenchymal haematoma compressing conus medullaris and cauda equina from D12 to L4. After intravenous gadolinium administration, no contrast uptake suggestive of an underlying lesion was observed. Subsequently, a decompressive laminectomy was performed from L1 to L4 and a longitudinal durotomy, after which the cauda equina was observed under high tension, contained by the intact arachnoid membrane. A small amount of subarachnoid blood clot compressed the conus medullaris dorsally. Exploration of the lateral areas showed the presence of a large ventral haematoma also contained by the arachnoid membrane. The arachnoid was then incised longitudinally and after separation of the dorsal roots of the cauda equina the clot was accessed. It was only possible to achieve a subtotal removal of the clot, as it was partially organised and adhered to the nerve roots. No macroscopic lesions were observed that could be the origin of the haematoma. The surgical procedure was completed with the closure of the dural plane using a lyophilised plastia to widen the space. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient achieved a progressive recovery of strength and was able to ambulate on the fourth day, without sphincteric alterations or radicular pain, and reported only a slight residual cramping in the lower limbs. In the following weeks, oncological treatment and bone marrow transplant were continued, but the patient developed a series of systemic complications that finally led to multi-organ failure and his death one month after the surgery. A post-surgical lumbar MRI could not be performed due to the patient's poor clinical condition.   "
"A patient aged 5 years and 7 months, with no personal or family history of interest, was admitted to our hospital on 12 June 2002 for a 10-day history of headache, predominantly in the evening, followed by convergent strabismus of the left eye and diplopia. Neurological examination revealed an awake, cooperative and environmentally connected child, with convergent strabismus of the left eye with preserved ocular motility and horizontal nystagmus on forced gaze to the right. Blood tests, biochemistry and chest X-ray were normal. Cranial CT and MRI showed a well-defined mass located inside the right lateral ventricle at the level of the atrium and temporal horn, of homogeneous density and measuring 6 by 2.5 cm, with significant perilesional oedema and showing intense uptake after administration of intravenous contrast.  The patient underwent a transtemporal approach through the medial temporal gyrus with macroscopically complete excision of the tumour. The histopathological study showed a neoplastic meningothelial proliferation with a predominantly meningotheliomatous pattern and high cellularity, classifying the tumour as an atypical meningioma. The presence of high mitotic activity was striking, in some areas reaching 2-3 mitoses in 10 high-magnification fields, with the proliferating cells having larger nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The Ki-67 antibody activity, measured randomly in the whole tumour, ranged from 18-20%.  The girl's clinical evolution was favourable and she was discharged from hospital ten days after surgery with minimal convergent strabismus of the right eye. Despite not having undergone complementary treatment, the patient is currently asymptomatic and no signs of recurrence have been detected in follow-up imaging studies.  "
"Patient aged 45 years assessed in September 2000 for left hemiparesis. His medical history included smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, peritonitis at the age of 18 and myocardial infarction in 1999. After CT and MRI, cerebral angiography diagnosed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and 60% stenosis associated with pseudoaneurysm in the cervical tract of the left, with signs of dissection on MRI.  Contralateral supply was found to be present. Using the right common femoral approach, a monorail metallic stent (Carotid wallstent, Boston Scientific Co.) was implanted in the area of the stenosis that also extended over the pseudoaneurysmal area of the cervical course of the left internal carotid artery.  A microcatheter was introduced through the stent mesh and GDC coils (Boston Scientific Co.) were released without risk of migration. A post-procedural angiographic control showed the recovery of the lumen in the stenotic zone and the absence of filling of the pseudoaneurysm. During the procedure, 5000 IU of sodium heparin was administered. Sequential anticoagulation therapy was performed in the acute phase with sodium heparin in continuous perfusion, followed by dicoumarinics and, subsequently, antiplatelet agents.  After three years of evolution, angiographic and echographic controls showed patency of the treated artery without recurrence of the pseudoaneurysm; the patient has not presented neurological symptoms in the left carotid territory.   "
"A 28-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of a regional hospital presenting, as a result of a car accident, with polytrauma with fracture of the 6th costal arch and right pulmonary contusion, renal laceration with right subcapsular and suprarenal haematoma, haematoma of the abdominal wall, dislocation of the right elbow and ligament injury in the knee on the same side, injuries with loss of substance in both lower limbs, and no signs of TBI. The patient required orotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure, and blood transfusions due to acute anaemia, and was admitted to the ICU. Extubated after 48 hours without incident, he was transferred to the hospital ward 24 hours later, where he remained for ten days, and a plaster cast was placed on the right lower limb. Since being discharged from hospital, 13 days after the traumatism, the patient presents pain at dorsal-lumbar level, initially attributed to the renal traumatism, which in the last 7 days is associated with a subjective sensation of loss of strength with paresthesia-dysesthesia in both lower limbs, more pronounced when lying down, and in the last 72 hours, difficulty in starting urination and constipation. One month after the trauma, the patient attended the regional hospital where an X-ray of the thoracic and lumbar spine was performed, showing an increase in the interspinous distance in the anteroposterior projection, and in the lateral projection an anterior displacement of the vertebral body of T11 on T12, with a possible dislocation of the articular facets at this level, and a minimal fracture of the most anterior portion of the vertebral body of T12. An MRI of the area was performed in which the existence of haematomas in the canal was ruled out, confirming the findings of the X-ray, and with a doubtful image of spinal cord contusion. Blood was also observed at the level of the interspinous ligament. The patient was referred to our department. On admission, the patient presented mild paraparesis (4+/5), predominantly proximal, with no sensory deficits, mild symmetrical bilateral patellar hyperreflexia, with no signs of pyramidal release. A CT scan was performed, which in axial sections revealed the existence of an abnormal arrangement of the T11-T12 facets, with stenosis of the canal at that level, the existence of a sign of the naked facet, and the sagittal and three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed dislocation and blockage of the articular facets at the T11-T12 level bilaterally. The patient underwent surgery through a posterior approach, with excision of a scar magma at both joints, curettage of the veneers of the upper FA of T12, and open reduction of the dislocation by means of distraction-extension manoeuvres, achieving almost complete reduction after performing a bilateral partial laminectomy, which facilitated reduction, followed by T11-T12 fixation with pedicle screws, bars and autologous graft. The patient evolved favourably, his neurological symptoms disappearing in the first week, and he was discharged pain-free and ambulating normally.  "
"Adolescent aged 14 years, admitted for treatment of a cervical disc herniation at C4-C5 level. One month earlier she had begun to suffer from right cervicobrachialgia and cervical muscle contractures, without neurological deficits. The pain improved with conservative treatment, but a few days later she began to have difficulty abducting her right upper limb. Physical examination revealed a loss of strength in the right deltoid and biceps (grades 2/5 and 4/5 respectively). There were no sensory alterations or pyramidalism in the lower limbs. Cervical spine X-rays showed loss of height in the vertebral bodies of C4-C5-C6, as well as calcification at the level of the C4-C5 disc. Cervical MRI revealed a voluminous right C4-C5 disc herniation involving the ipsilateral root. A cervical computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the herniation was calcified. A complete analytical study was performed, showing no abnormalities in the haemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or phosphocalcic metabolism. A scintigraphy ruled out pathological uptake.  This patient had been diagnosed at the age of 10 years with idiopathic intervertebral calcifications following a radiographic study due to cervical pain. This study showed the existence of a calcification at the level of C4-C5 and several calcifications at the dorsal level. An MRI ruled out any disc herniation. Until the current episode, she had been asymptomatic, except for occasional back pain. Given the patient's neurological deficit, surgical treatment of the disc herniation via the anterolateral approach was chosen. During surgery, an intervertebral disc with fine calcifications was observed. When the posterior common vertebral ligament was opened, a whitish, pasty material came out, which was under moderate tension. The pathological report of the material obtained was fibrocartilage with foci of calcification. One month later the patient had fully recovered from her deficits.   "
"A 54-year-old male patient, smoker and moderate drinker, allergic to penicillins, with a history of episodes of maxillary sinusitis and pansinusitis. He was diagnosed with a plasmacytoma of the left frontal sinus following a sinus puncture biopsy in another hospital, where it was surgically excised by means of an incision at the level of the left eyebrow and an osteotomy of the anterior wall of the sinus. A fragment of the sinus cavity was obtained for anatomopathological analysis confirming the presence of the plasmacytoma. Histopathological analysis of the excised sinus mucosa was also performed, which was reported as a possible abscessed mucocele (mucopiocele). He was subsequently referred to the haematology department of our hospital for further treatment. Bone scintigraphy showed pathological deposition of the tracer in the maxillary sinus, nasal bones and frontal sinuses, suggesting the presence of myeloma. Three cycles of chemotherapy were administered one month apart, consisting of vincristine, adriomycin and dexamethasone + Aredia (1st cycle); cyclophosphamide, etopoxide, dexamethasone + Aredia (2nd cycle); and cyclophosphamide, adriomycin, dexamethasone + Aredia (3rd cycle). Two days after the end of the third cycle of chemotherapy treatment, an increase in tumour was observed in the frontal region, with signs of local inflammation of 24 hours of evolution. On examination, a soft tumour was palpable in the frontal region, draining abundant purulent material through two orifices located in the eyebrow, with headache and fever of 38ºC. Samples were taken for culture and antibiogram (no microorganisms were isolated). Skull X-ray showed a radiolucent area at the level of the frontal bone. CT and MRI confirmed the presence of thickening of the frontal bone and occupation of its cavities with a lytic area on the left side suggestive of osteomyelitis with areas of sequestration at frontal level.  The patient was referred to our Maxillofacial Surgery Department and after evaluation of the patient, it was decided to carry out surgical treatment. A butterfly incision was made in the glabellar region including the fistulous tract. After detaching the flap, the frontal sinus, which had lost its external table, was visualised, cleaned and curetted, and the sinus walls were reamed with rotating material. A 50 cc cortico-cancellous bone graft was taken from the right proximal tibia using a trocar, which was mixed with a previously prepared PRP growth factor-rich fraction concentrate. 250 cc of venous blood was drawn to prepare the PRP, centrifuged using a two-stage technique (Platelet Concentrate Collection System PCCS; 3i/Implant Innovations, Palm Beach Gardens, FL®), and the two fractions were separated. Prior to application, the PRP clot was activated by calcium chloride. In total, a mixture of 40 cc of material was obtained, with which both sinus cavities were completely filled. The surgical wound was sutured and plasma poor in growth factors was placed over the scar.  The curettage material from both sinus cavities was sent for pathology analysis. The result reported the presence of mixed inflammatory tissue with bone and soft tissue involvement, ruling out recurrence of plasmacytoma, and the diagnosis was chronic osteomyelitis of the frontal sinus. The patient was discharged after five days of hospitalisation with no symptoms or postoperative complications. There were no complications at the donor site, and the patient was discharged without discomfort. CT scans were performed six and twelve months after the operation, showing complete filling of the sinus cavity, with no signs of disease. The patient had no further frontal swelling or discharge, headaches or fever. The aesthetic appearance of the surgical wound is very satisfactory....   "
"We present the clinical case of a 50-year-old woman, a tightrope walker by profession, with no personal history of interest, who progressively developed, over a period of about 10 years, a malformation of the scalp consisting of a left frontal irregular mass, approximately 12x11 cm in its main axes, pulsatile, with significant development of the vascular network of the cranial calotte, in charge of the superficial temporal arteries and their venous return branches. In the anamnesis, the patient recalls a traumatic history 12 years ago, with frontal contusion, after which she suffered a large bifrontal subgaleal haematoma, which resolved conservatively over the course of approximately two months. Apart from this incident, he reported no other symptoms and the physical and neurological examination was normal. In view of the suspicion of a traumatic arteriovenous malformation, imaging tests were requested. Cerebral MRI showed no significant alterations and cerebral angiography of the internal and external carotid artery territories showed a left frontal epicranial vascular nidus, with extracranial vascular contributions from both superficial temporal arteries, and contributions from the intracranial circulation by transosseous meningeal branches coming from the ethmoidal arteries and dependent in turn on the two ophthalmic arteries, left and right. Neither the embolisation of the intracranial branches due to the high risk of amaurosis of one or both eyes, nor of the extracranial branches was carried out, as it was considered possible to resect the AVM by surgical intervention alone. A bicoronal incision was made behind the nidus, bilaterally accessing the nourishing branches of the AVM, in order to first ligate and section them and thus reduce the blood supply to the lesion and make resection of the lesion possible with controlled bleeding. The nidus was located outside the pericranium and under the subcutaneous cellular tissue, and showed irrigation through the calotte from the intracranial branches as evidenced by the previous angiography. Radiofrequency coagulation, both mono and bipolar, and bone wax were used to control haemorrhage. All subcutaneous blood vessels were resected, and hair follicles were evident only in a few isolated areas. During surgery it was necessary to transfuse with two red blood cell concentrates, and a blood salvager (ORTHOPAT HAEMONETICS) was used to better control blood loss. The scalp was sutured in the usual way by planes and the skin was sutured with agrafes. Postoperatively, there were no neurological complications and the wound healed adequately, with no areas of necrosis or alopecia developing. The cosmetic result was excellent. After one year she has shown no recurrence.   "
"64-year-old woman with a personal history of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol. She was seen at the outpatient clinic for a clinical picture of inability to ambulate and occasional urinary incontinence, with impairment of higher functions and emotional lability. Neuroimaging studies showed tetraventricular hydrocephalus. Suspicion of CAH led to the placement of a DLE as a diagnostic test. After replacing acenocoumarol with low molecular weight heparin a few weeks earlier, the DLE was placed. During the transfer of the patient from the operating theatre to the hospital ward, the drain was accidentally kept open. Six hours after placement, after draining 240 ml of CSF, the patient began to experience headaches, nausea, vomiting and sweating, which were initially attributed to intracranial hypotension. At no time did the level of consciousness deteriorate. In view of the intensity of the symptoms, an urgent cranial CT scan was performed which showed the presence of a haematoma in the left cerebellar vermis and hemisphere, with subarachnoid bleeding on the upper surface of the cerebellum and in the cerebellar folia. The DLE was removed immediately and, given the patient's good clinical condition, it was decided to follow conservative treatment, with good clinical evolution. Neuroimaging studies (MRI and cerebral angiography) ruled out the existence of underlying pathology.  The patient recovered to her previous state. Subsequently, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was implanted, with great clinical improvement.   "
"A 77-year-old woman with a single history of arterial hypertension. She presented with a clinical picture consisting of gait ataxia, sphincter incontinence and disturbance of higher functions. Neuroimaging studies showed dilatation of the ventricular system, so, with the suspicion of CAH, a DLE was placed. Thirty hours after placement, the patient suddenly began to present headaches and vomiting not associated with orthostatism. There was no deterioration in the level of consciousness. The drainage bag contained 510 ml of CSF. A cranial CT scan showed a haematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere, transversely arranged, with little mass effect. In view of the findings and the patient's clinical situation, it was decided to remove the DLE and treat conservatively. The brain MRI performed prior to admission had ruled out underlying pathology. After five days the patient was discharged with recovery to her premorbid state. No shunt valve was implanted as there was no improvement with DLE placement.  "
"A 26-year-old woman with no previous neurological history, asthmatic and on treatment with oral contraceptives, presented with a picture of very intense holocranial headache accompanied by photophobia, nausea and vomiting without fever for about 24 hours of evolution, which was suddenly complicated the following morning with gait instability and diplopia. The neurological examination revealed mild nuchal rigidity, right internuclear ophthalmoplegia, staggering Romberg and left lateropulsion in gait, the rest being normal. A computerised axial tomography was performed, showing a lesion with negative density (-20 to -67 Hounsfield Units) located in the temporal region as well as multiple oval images scattered throughout the right suprasellar cisterns, bilateral quadrigeminae, pontocerebellar angle and frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle, which were interpreted as fat particles. With suspicion of chemical meningitis due to rupture of a dermoid cyst, treatment was started with dexamethasone at a dose of 4 milligrams every 12 hours. A brain MRI scan six days after the onset of symptoms showed an extraparenchymal mass corresponding to the cyst in the medial region of the left temporal pole, ascending to occupy the anterior area of the left perimesencephalic cistern, and dissemination of fat in the subarachnoid space; In addition, a hyperintense image is observed in the paramedial region of the midbrain in the T2-weighted sequences, which is hyperintense in the diffusion sequences and hypointense in the ADC map, compatible with an ischaemic infarction. The MRI is completed with T1 and EGD sequences with fat suppression after gadolinium administration, showing small fat particles scattered in the subarachnoid space; the fat accumulation in the interpeduncular cistern in close contact with the distal part of the basilar and the theoretical exit of the mesencephalic medial perforating branches, superior cerebellar arteries and posterior cerebral arteries is striking. Figure 1 shows a composition with the most representative neuroimaging of the case. Following the results of this test, treatment was started with acetylsalicylic acid at a dose of 100 mg per day and the aetiological study of the stroke was completed with blood tests, haemogram, lipidogram, autoimmunity study, serology, thyroid hormones, homocysteine, anticardiolipin antibodies, B2-microglobulin, antiphospholipid, cerebrospinal fluid study, electrocardiogram, supra-aortic trunk duplex, transcranial Doppler, bubble test, transthoracic echocardiography, arrhythmia holter and angioresonance of Willis polygon; all with normal or negative results. The headache responded to dexamethasone administration in less than 48 hours and the ophthalmoparesis and instability resolved after 10 days, leaving the patient asymptomatic. The patient was diagnosed with isolated anteromedial mesencephalic infarction possibly secondary to vasospasm of paramedian mesencephalic perforating arteries in relation to subarachnoid dissemination of the fatty content of a ruptured temporal dermoid cyst. In agreement with the patient, the neurosurgery department decided on a wait-and-see attitude and serial neuroimaging controls, leaving elective surgery for the case of the appearance of symptomatology due to tumour compression.   "
"This is a 52 year old female patient, with no previous history of interest, referred to our department for surgical assessment. She had presented, for four years, with a small tumour on the right side of her forehead, which had been slowly increasing in size. On examination, a hard, painless, non-mobile mass was palpable under normal-appearing skin. Plain X-ray and CT scan of the skull showed a right frontal intraosseous lesion with osteolytic features. Radiological differential diagnosis included metastases, myeloma and haemangioma. Systemic tumour screening studies (haemogram, haematological smear, tumour markers, proteinogram and cervico-thoracic-abdominal CT scan) were negative. A bone scan with HDP-Tc99M was performed, showing a rounded deposit in the area of the lesion. Percutaneous fine needle puncture-aspiration of the tumour was inconclusive for the diagnosis, as only haematic fragments were obtained.  Finally, it was decided to operate on the patient on the basis of the clinical progression of the lesion, with its aesthetic implications, as well as to obtain a definitive histological diagnosis. During surgery, a bone-dependent tumour was identified, with multiple dilated vascular channels in its sinus, expanding the external table. To avoid manipulation of the lesion, it was decided to include it in a craniectomy specimen with a circumferential margin of 1 cm of apparently healthy bone. The resulting bone defect was reconstructed by means of a methylmethacrylate cranial plasty, which was fixed to the surrounding bone with titanium mini-plates. The postoperative period was uneventful. The definitive anatomopathological diagnosis was intraosseous cavernous haemangioma.  "
"A 19-year-old male patient referred from a regional hospital for surgery for hydrocephalus. He had a history of approximately 1 year of left hemicranial headache that worsened on exertion. In recent weeks the headache had increased in intensity and frequency. The neurological examination showed only bilateral papillary oedema. The patient provided a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showing supratentorial ventricular dilatation with an Evans index of 0.43, periependymal clearing in the frontal horn and a small tectal lesion that was not modified by contrast. The fourth ventricle was normal.  With the diagnosis of stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius, an endoscopic premamillary ventriculocysternostomy was performed through a right frontal trephine hole according to the standard technique3. A Mayfield clamp (Ohio Medical Instrument Co, Inc., Cincinnati, Oh, USA) was used for head immobilisation. The immediate postoperative period was uneventful, although the patient suffered from headache. Forty-eight hours after surgery and prior to the scheduled discharge from hospital, a new MRI was performed in which the presence of a left parietal epidural haematoma with a mass effect on the ipsilateral lateral ventricle was noted.  A left parietal craniotomy was then performed, showing a perforation that went through the entire bone without affecting the dura mater. The haematoma was drained and a small bleeding dural artery was coagulated. The patient was discharged after 6 days with only some degree of headache. One year after surgery he is asymptomatic and the tectal lesion shows no change on MRI studies.   "
"This is a 74-year-old male who had undergone surgery for a left frontal parasagittal transitional meningioma (WHO grade I). One month after this surgery, he consulted for infection of the surgical wound, which had a central dehiscent area from which purulent material was coming out. The patient had had no fever, his general condition was good and he had a normal neurological examination. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at that time showed, adjacent to the craniectomy site, a hypodense subdural collection, with bubbles inside, which was peripherally enhanced after gadolinium administration. The craniotomy was reopened and a purulent epidural collection emerged, which was evacuated and sent for microbiological study. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous ceftazidime and vancomycin. Bacterial cultures were negative. The patient was discharged with oral treatment with ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole for two weeks.  One and a half months after discharge, the patient was brought to the emergency department for a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. He had been febrile for the previous days with no other clinical data of interest. On physical examination he was in good general condition, afebrile, had a Glasgow Glasgow of 15/15, showed no neurological focality and the surgical wound showed no evidence of infection. Anticonvulsant treatment was started and a CT scan was performed, which revealed a predominantly hypodense subdural collection, with peripheral enhancement after contrast administration and a convex internal margin towards the brain parenchyma. Air persisted within the collection. Empirical antibiotic treatment was started with ceftazidime and vancomycin. With the diagnostic suspicion of recurrence of subdural empyema, a third craniectomy was performed which revealed a subdural collection with a purulent appearance that was evacuated. Samples were sent for microbiology from the drained material and from a craniectomy specimen adjacent to the collection which was removed for therapeutic purposes due to possible infection and embedded in thioglycollate broth for processing.  After 5 days of incubation, growth of Proprionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) was observed after subculture in solid medium and in anaerobic atmosphere of the enrichment broth. An antibiogram by E-test was performed, showing resistance to metronidazole and sensitivity to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftazidime, clindamycin and vancomycin. Treatment with vancomycin and ceftazidime was discontinued and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was started. The patient's evolution was good and he was discharged with oral amoxicillin for one month and a diagnosis of ""recurrence of post-surgical subdural empyema due to Propionibacterium acnes"".   "
"A 62-year-old woman, hypertensive and hypercholesterolaemic on pharmacological treatment. Diagnosed with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the colon with multiple liver metastases. Under chemotherapy treatment with mFOLFOX 6 + Bevacizumab (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, leucovorin 200 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, 5-FU 400 mg/m2 i.v. bolus day 1, 5-FU 1. 200 mg/m2/day in a 48 h continuous infusion and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg i.v. day 1) with good tolerance, except for neurotoxicity that causes the suspension of oxaliplatin after cycle no. 15. He began with a sudden onset of pain and itching in the right costal region, with painful bullous lesions, metamaterally distributed, ulcerated and suppurative. She consulted her primary care physician, who prescribed treatment for VZV with brivudine (Nervinex® 125 mg tablets) 1 tablet/24 h v.o. for 7 days, of which she only took 4 days as the treatment was replaced by famciclovir. Chemotherapy was postponed until the lesions improved, and the next cycle was given 4 days after the end of the brivudine treatment. Eleven days later, she came to the emergency department with abdominal pain with expulsion of melaenic stools, pain in the oral cavity and dysphagia. On arrival at the ED, she was afebrile, with blood pressure of 101/68 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, and baseline oxygen saturation of 100%. The haemogram showed marked leukopenia, with neutrophil count of 50/µl, and thrombopenia (61 χ 103 platelets/µl). Respiratory and contact isolation was established. Serum therapy and treatment with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy was started (meropenem plus vancomycin, then amikacin, acyclovir and fluconazole, which was replaced by caspofungin after 7 days of treatment due to fever and sustained neutropenia). Despite treatment, he presented frequent febrile peaks, so repeated blood cultures were performed, which were sterile, as well as antifungal antibody, β-glucan and galactomannan tests, which were negative. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors (filgrastim) were administered, 2 platelet concentrates were transfused and total parenteral nutrition was started. For pain management, analgesia with morphine, adjuvant NSAIDs, topical application of 2% viscous lidocaine and sucralfate for oral lesions were prescribed. Topical treatment of the herpetic lesions on the right side was with 0.1% zinc sulphate fomentation. Physical examination revealed marked generalised skin pigmentation and alopecia, both related to 5-FU toxicity. Despite the established supportive measures, there was a worsening of the general condition, with abundant respiratory secretions, poor pain control, without haematological recovery (last blood test: platelets = 51 χ 103 µl; neutrophils = 370/µl). The patient died of acute respiratory failure due to sepsis of respiratory origin.   "
"A 61-year-old woman with multiple previous hospital admissions for episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, with a history of mitral valve disease with prosthetic valve replacement and on treatment with acenocoumarol. In April 2011, she was admitted for intestinal bleeding of unaffiliated origin and severe iron deficiency anaemia, a gastroscopy and capsule endoscopy were performed without significant findings, after which it was decided to reduce the INR range to 2.5-3. Two months later, he presented a new episode of intestinal bleeding, after which a capsule endoscopy was performed again, showing the existence of intestinal angiodysplasias in the duodenal antrum, proximal jejunum and terminal ileum, with no evidence of bleeding from any other cause. He was subsequently admitted three times for the same reason, requiring multiple units (U) of red blood cell concentrates. Enteroscopy was performed orally up to the middle jejunum, during which no angiodysplasias were found, and it was impossible to assess the existence of ileal angiodysplasias. At the last admission she had a haemoglobin of 10.5 g, with a haematocrit of 0.340 L/L and a mean corpuscular volume of 25.7 pg. After this new episode, and the episodes of bleeding persisted, with no clear lesions to perform other measures such as electrofulguration or surgery, it was decided to use thalidomide, at a dose of 50 mg daily, as a drug for compassionate use, following the patient's handwritten authorisation. The patient was asymptomatic for three months, with haemoglobin levels of 124 g/L and a negative faecal occult blood test over time. After this period, she was admitted for a significant deterioration of her general condition, with dyspnoea on minimal effort, orthopnoea, malleolar oedema and no chest pain. Urgent echocardiography was requested and was reported as severe pulmonary hypertension with a PSAP (pulmonary artery systolic pressure) of 100mmHg, (prior to the start of thalidomide treatment, the patient had a PSAP of 26mmHg measured by ultrasound) and a study was performed to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism, with negative D-dimer and angiographic tomography. There was no evidence of other causes for the elevated PSAP, so the drug was discontinued and treatment was started with monthly lanreotide.   "
"Male, 57 years old, history of no interest and smoker of 10-20 cigarettes/day. The patient presented with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1a/1c, viral load 1,662,178 Ul/ml and a fibrosis grade F2-F3 (Fibroscan 9.9 Kilopascals) with an IL-28 CT polymorphism. It was decided to start his first treatment for hepatitis C with RBV 400mg/12h, P-INF alpha 2a 180mcg/week and Telaprevir 750mg/8h (with meals). At the start of treatment the patient had a haemoglobin (Hb) of 157 g/L, neutrophil count 4.2x109 no/L and 1 58x109 no/L platelets. Liver enzymes were slightly increased, GPT 114 IU/L, ALAT 115 IU/L and ASAT 80 IU/L. At week 4 the patient presented undetectable viral load, Hb 136 g/L, neutrophil count 2.0 x 109 no/L and platelets 110 x 109 no/L. He reported anorectal discomfort, specifically haemorrhoids and anal itching, mild anxiety that improved with Lorazepam and mild body itching that improved with the use of emollient creams. In week 8 of treatment she was admitted to hospital with epigastric pain that became more intense and radiated to both hypochondria during the last 36 hours. She had no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting or choluria. Laboratory tests showed an amylase of 1888 IU/L, Hb 107 g/L, neutrophil count 2.7 x 109 no/L and platelet count 97x109 no/L. Absolute diet (except for taking Telaprevir, with whole milk) and analgesic and antiemetic measures were instituted. The patient progressed favourably and was discharged after one week of hospitalisation with an amylase level of 173 IU/L. The following day he was admitted again with intense epigastric pain radiating to both hypochondria and an amylase level of 3406 IU/L. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. Given the recurrent course (two admissions), Telaprevir was discontinued (week 9 of treatment) due to the possibility that it was the cause and he continued with RBV and P-INF. The patient was discharged five days later with an amylase level of 365 IU/L. At week 12 post initiation of treatment, viral load was undetectable, Hb 109 g/L, neutrophil count 1.1 x109 no/L and platelet count 1 58x109 no/L. He will continue treatment without Telaprevir until week 24.   "
"A 62-year-old man with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus secondary to chronic calcific pancreatitis with a tendency to hypoglycaemia due to the administration of rapid insulin, multiple admissions for urinary infectious conditions and functional deterioration. On admission, he suffered from neglect of personal hygiene with uncontrolled elimination habits, malnutrition, chronic renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis and a grade III sacral ulcer. Culture of the ulcer exudate showed that it was positive for MRSA and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the antibiogram showed that MRSA was sensitive only to colistin (MIC < 2) and intermediate to amikacin (MIC = 16). MRSA was sensitive to co-trimoxazole (MIC < 1/19) and intermediate to clindamycin (MIC = 1.9). Treatment was initiated with colistin cream 0.1% with daily application to the dressing and oral cotrimoxazole 800/160 mg every 12 hours for MRSA treatment. After one month of treatment, a favourable clinical evolution of the ulcer was observed, with growth of edges and granulation tissue, which had not been observed prior to topical treatment. The patient died due to chronic renal failure exacerbated by urinary sepsis, for which reason a post-treatment culture was not available.  "
"43-year-old man infected with HCV genotype 1a and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with liver fibrosis grade F4 (cirrhosis), FibroScan of 27 kPa and Child-Pugh grade A. On HIV treatment since February 2010 (tenofovir + emtricitabine + raltegravir). The patient presented RP below normal levels (<120 x 109/L) since diagnosis of HCC (December 2008). Prior to initiation of antiviral therapy for HCC, the patient had grade III thrombocytopenia (PR = 42 x 109/L), grade III neutropenia (neutrophils = 0.66 x 109/L) and haemoglobin (Hb) values within normal range (Hb = 14.1 g/dL). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values were within normal range (35 and 36 IU/mL, respectively) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) was found slightly elevated (62 IU/mL). HCV viral load (CVVHC) was 180,000 copies/mL and CVHIV was undetectable. In March 2012 he started treatment for HCC with pegIFN-α2a and RBV (180 mcg/week and 1,000 mg/day, respectively) for 11 weeks. At week 12, presenting with a PR of 26 x 109/L, TVR (750 mg/8hours) was added. The PR decreased progressively to 16 x 109/L at week 14, at which time treatment with eltrombopag 50 mg/day was started and the dose of pegIFN-α2a was reduced to 135 mcg/week. At weeks 16 and 17 the PR remained below normal values (14 x 109/L and 13 x 109/L, respectively). At week 22 the PR rose to 34 x 109/L and the dose of eltrombopag was increased to 75 mg/day, the type of IFN (from pegIFN-α2a to pegIFN-α2b) and its dose (from 135 mcg to 80 mcg/week) was changed to coincide with the end of TVR treatment. The dose of eltrombopag was reduced to 50 mg/day at week 30 and at week 35 it was discontinued due to a PR of 50 x 109/L. At the end of treatment (week 48), the PR was 67 x 109 platelets/L with undetectable CVVHC (< 15 copies/mL) since week 15.   "
"A 55-year-old man diagnosed in 2006 with CLL who received immunochemotherapy treatment in 2008 with Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide-Fludarabine, achieving a partial response. In 2011, there was evidence of disease progression and he started second-line treatment with Rituximab 375mg/m2 day 1 of the cycle and Bendamustine 90 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 every 28 days. Four hours after administration of day 1 of the second immunochemotherapy cycle, the patient attended the emergency department with a dysthermic sensation, fever of 38oC and an urticarial reaction with pruritus and scaly erythroderma over 50% of the body surface that persisted for 15 days. It was decided to perform skin tests with bendamustine because of the possibility of an allergic reaction to this cytostatic. The stock solution used was bendamustine 2.5mg/ml, with 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10000 dilutions for intradermal administration. Given the previous good tolerance to rituximab for 6 cycles, the skin reaction was associated with bendamustine. The toxicoderma was classified as grade 4 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4.0)9 and reported by yellow card to the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System. Skin tests were negative for all dilutions. However, following the benefit/risk assessment between the severity of the toxicoderma and the potential benefit of bendamustine treatment, it was decided to develop a PD for the administration of the next cycles of bendamustine. The PD consisted of 12 steps for the administration of the full dose of the drug (186.3mg). The protocol consisted of progressively increasing the infusion rate and drug concentration until the total therapeutic dose was reached. Three solutions A, B, and C were prepared from 1/100, 1/10 and 1/1 dilutions respectively. Each of the solutions was used for four steps, increasing the infusion rate every 15 minutes, so that with each step twice as much drug was administered as in the previous step. In the last step, the rate was kept constant until the total defined dose was administered. Table 1 summarises the solutions and the administration schedule of the desensitisation protocol.  The administration was performed on the haematology ward under medical supervision, with a total duration of 5 hours and 37 minutes. The patient received 6 cycles of immunochemotherapy with bendamustine using this PD with mild skin pruritus but no serious complications.   "
"60-year-old woman diagnosed in January 2010 with BCR-ABL positive CML. From diagnosis until April 2011 she received treatment with imatinib 400mg/day with acceptable tolerance (moderate symptoms of tiredness, pain, burning and swelling in the legs, oedema of the eyelids and appearance of whitish lesions in the nail bed) and a very rapid haematological response, with normalisation of the haemogram within a week. In April 2011, due to the progression of the molecular signal and the acquisition of the Y253F mutation in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM), imatinib was replaced by dasatinib 100mg/day. The Y253F mutation confers resistance to imatinib, intermediate sensitivity to nilotinib and sensitivity to dasatinib. The patient presented good clinical tolerance during treatment with dasatinib, except for the appearance of a persistent cough and asthenia, achieving a major molecular response. During treatment with dasatinib, the patient developed pancytopenia with blast infiltration of the BM, a diagnosis of lymphoid blast crisis was made and the T315I mutation in the ABL kinase domain was detected. Once morphological remission of the blast crisis was achieved after the administration of induction chemotherapy with vincristine, daunorubicin, steroids and intrathecal prophylaxis and given the previous exposure to imatinib and dasatinib, the haematology department decided to start treatment with ponatinib in September 2012. Initially, the dose administered was 45mg per day, which had to be reduced to 30mg per day due to clinical intolerance, mainly osteomuscular pain, asthenia and elevated blood pressure, which required adjustment of the antihypertensive treatment. Currently, the patient maintains a complete haematological and molecular response with acceptable tolerance. She has recently been assessed in the pre-transplant consultation of the Haematology Department for the possibility of consolidation with allogeneic HSCT from an unrelated donor, as she does not have an HLA-matched sibling.   "
"A 36-year-old man, with no medical history of interest, attended the Emergency Department, presenting with paraesthesia in both upper limbs, accompanied by drowsiness. Two hours before admission, he referred the application of 270 g (9 bottles of 30 g) of EMLA® anaesthetic cream (lidocaine 2.5%, prilocaine 2.5%) for laser depilation on the back, upper and lower limbs. The patient was conscious and oriented, sleepy and cyanosed. Blood pressure was 144/83 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm and a baseline SaO2 of 91%, so oxygen therapy was started until SaO2 94% was reached. The rest of the examination was normal. Complementary tests (chest X-ray and electrocardiogram) showed no significant pathological alterations. The admission blood test (4 hours after application of EMLA®, see Table 1) showed a methaemoglobin level of 10.1%, and he was diagnosed with severe methaemoglobinaemia secondary to topical administration of EMLA® (lidocaine 2.5%, prilocaine 2.5%). Administration of 100 mg methylene blue was started intravenously within 10 minutes. One hour after administration of the antidote, his methaemoglobin level remained elevated (2.7%), and he also presented alkalosis, so he was assessed by the Intensive Care Unit. After transfer to this unit, he continued high-flow mask oxygen therapy, improving the cutaneous-mucosal discolouration and recovering SaO2 to 96%. Twenty-four hours after the application of EMLA®, the patient remained haemodynamically stable and the methaemoglobin level dropped to 0.2%, so it was decided to transfer him to the Internal Medicine Department, where, given his favourable evolution, it was decided to discharge him three days after his admission.   "
"We present a case of cervical myoclonias probably associated with Etanercept. A 16-year-old woman, diagnosed with severe plaque psoriasis, under dermatological follow-up and on treatment with Etanercept 25 mg twice a week. She consulted for abnormal cervical movements in March 2013. She had started treatment with etanercept 25 mg twice weekly in May 2012 for a flare-up of severe plaque psoriasis that did not respond to topical (clobetasol, calcipotriol, betamethasone + calcipotriol) and oral (ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil) treatments. After 12 weeks of treatment, a complete clinical response was achieved and the drug was withdrawn. One week after the last dose of etanercept, administered on 29 June 2012, he developed granulomatous interstitial dermatitis of the extremities, which was attributed to the withdrawal of etanercept6. In November 2012, she had a new flare-up of psoriasis, and the severity was assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) calculation, with a PASI of 18.60. Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly was restarted and clinical improvement was achieved after 15 weeks of treatment. On 5 March 2013, the patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for a 48-hour history of sudden, involuntary, repetitive, arrhythmic and sustained movements of the head to the left during sleep. He had received the last dose of etanercept on 27 February 2013. The condition was not accompanied by any other systemic symptoms. The movements caused twitching of the left upper limb, were painless and associated with hypoaesthesia in the hemiface and anterior portion from D4 to L2. She did not report similar previous episodes or movement alterations at these or other levels suggesting a personal history of myoclonus, dystonia or any other type of involuntary movement. On physical examination he was afebrile and haemodynamically stable. The neurological examination revealed nociceptive hypoaesthesia in the left hemiface and anterolateral part of the trunk from D2 to L2, and D2 to D8 in the back. Among the complementary tests, an electroencephalogram was performed, showing myoclonic movements of left cervical flexion and elevation of the left shoulder, presenting over the temporoparietal region of the same hemisphere a graphoelement with a spike morphology that precedes the movement by 200-400 ms, interpreted as an artefact due to muscle contraction. In view of the clinical suspicion of AMR due to Etanercept, the drug was withdrawn and an exhaustive search was requested from the hospital's Pharmacy Service on the reactions described with Etanercept. Treatment was started with carbamazepine 100 mg for suspected paroxysmal dyskinesias, which was discontinued due to dizziness and nausea. Subsequently, treatment was prescribed with clonacepam 0.5 mg 1-1-2, levitiracetam 250 mg c/12 h, valproic acid 500 mg c/8 h and diazepam 2.5 mg 0-1-2 without improvement. A differential diagnosis was made between spinal myoclonias, although without long tract involvement, paroxysmal non-kinesiogenic dyskinesias or dystonia-myoclonias. One week after admission, the clinical picture began to respond with diazepam at doses of 2.5 mg 1-1-2, clonazepam 0.5 mg 1-1-2, valproic 500 mg c/8 h, levetiracetam 1000 mg c/12 h and biperidene 2 mg c/8 h. On the tenth day, the patient was discharged from the hospital. On the tenth day she was discharged with clinical improvement and treatment with clonazepam 0.5 mg 1-1-2, biperiden 4 mg c/24 h and levetiracetam 1000 mg c/12 h in a descending regimen.   "
"A 24-year-old woman from the United States, weighing 70 kg and 175 cm, with no past history of interest, attended the emergency department with a dry cough, precordial discomfort, watery diarrhoea and fever. Examination revealed bilateral crackles and respiratory failure (baseline oxygen saturation 80%). Chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates and bilateral pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with a left shift (11,700 - 109/L leukocytes, 81% neutrophils), CRP = 15.93 mg/mL and LDH = 1,154 IU/L. The following microbiological studies were performed, which were negative: two blood cultures, urine culture, antigenuria for Legionella and pneumococcus, pharyngeal swab for detection of Adenovirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus and Enterovirus and blood sample for detection of HIV infection (anti-HIV antibodies and Ag p24). With suspicion of severe community-acquired pneumonia, empirical intravenous (IV) treatment was started with ceftriaxone 2 g/24 h, levofloxacin 500 mg/12 h for three days, continuing with 500 mg/24 h and oxygen therapy. The patient was admitted to the ICU. In the first 48 hours the patient presented respiratory deterioration, requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, so on day +2 the IV antibiotic spectrum was extended to meropenem 1 g/6 h, linezolid 600 mg/12 h, liposomal amphotericin B 300 mg/24 h (to cover histoplasmosis) and acyclovir 750 mg/8 h. The patient's diarrhoea was limited to diarrhoea, which was limited to 2 days. Diarrhoea was limited. Due to progressive deterioration, doxycycline 100 mg/12 h iv, and methylprednisolone 60 mg/8 h iv were added on day +6 (due to the possibility of organisative pneumonia or vasculitis). The patient presented haemodynamic deterioration and progressive IR attributed to septic shock and nephrotoxicity, with a 24 h urine CLcr of 9.4 mL/min (day +6), being 106.5 mL/min on admission (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula from a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL). The aetiological study was extended with the determination of autoantibodies to rule out an autoimmune renopulmonary syndrome (anti-neutrophil cytoplasm and anti-basal membrane antibodies were negative), determination of galactomannan antigen in blood (negative) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), where new bacterial and fungal cultures were requested (negative) and detection of viral antigens, all negative except PCR for Adenovirus (result received on day +7). Given that this was the only microbiological isolation and given the plausibility of the aetiology, it was classified as Adenovirus pneumonia with secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome. The serotype was not identified. Due to the patient's acute IR and the negativity of other isolates, liposomal amphotericin B and acyclovir were discontinued, the remaining antibiotic treatment was adjusted (meropenem 1 g/12 h iv and levofloxacin 250 mg/48 h iv)6 , and treatment was started with ganciclovir 200 mg/24 h iv (adjusted for renal function), awaiting improvement in CLcr before starting cidofovir. Given the presence of oligoanuria, it was decided to start renal replacement support on day +11 in the form of HDFVVC due to haemodynamic instability (desired loss volume of 100-160 mL/h, blood flow = 160 mL/min, effluent flow = 2 L/h; acrylonitrile haemofilter with surface area = 0.9 m2) with the corresponding dose adjustment of antibiotic treatments (meropenem 500 mg/8 h iv and levofloxacin 250 mg/24 h iv)7. Three days later, empirical treatment with doxycycline and linezolid was discontinued. After starting ganciclovir, lymphopenia, plateletopenia and progressive anaemia accompanied by intra-alveolar bleeding were observed, and haematotoxicity may have been enhanced by previous linezolid treatment. Therefore, treatment with cidofovir was considered, even though renal function had not improved. Given the contraindication of its use in severe renal failure and the lack of references to its use in CVIDH in the technical data sheet, a literature search was performed in Pubmed and Micromedex without finding any reference. It was finally decided, taking into account the patient's renal function and the nephrotoxic effect of cidofovir, to initiate therapy with a reduced dose according to the strategy of Brody et al. in patients undergoing high-flux haemodialysis, and to consider empirically for our patient a CLcr of 40-50 mL/min (0.57-0.71 mL/kg/min). Thus, after obtaining informed family consent, an induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg (175 mg) was administered weekly for 2 weeks and every 15 days thereafter7. At the time of initiation of treatment (day +13) the patient had a residual diuresis of 300 mL/day. To prevent nephrotoxicity, the usual treatment (hydration and probenecid) was carried out. Throughout cidofovir treatment, the patient remained on haemodiafiltration and had no attributable adverse effects. On day +17, a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was found and treatment with vancomycin 1 g/24 h (CLcr 40 mL/min) was started. After three doses of treatment, plasma concentrations of this antibiotic were monitored, obtaining a minimum concentration of 13 mg/dL, in line with those expected with a CLcr of 40 mL/min, and so the same dosage was continued. After four doses of cidofovir, the PCR for Adenovirus was negative in LBA on day + 27. A lung biopsy was then performed where no signs suggestive of viral infection were found, and antiviral treatment was suspended. Despite the treatment given, the patient's evolution was unfavourable, with refractory respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring support with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), without further microbiological isolations, and increasing fibrosis component in the lung parenchyma as observed by transbronchial biopsy. The patient finally died after 52 days of hospitalisation.   "
"A 78-year-old man diagnosed in January 2012 with SS stage III-B/IV-A1 (T4N0M0) with extensive skin involvement, whose personal history was a smoker of 20 cigarettes a day, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was diagnosed with lichen planus in 2010 by the dermatology department, presenting with pruritus that was controlled with corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines, PUVA therapy and acitretin. When he was diagnosed with SS, oral chlorambucil was added to the therapy. After 10 months, in November 2012, loss of response was observed starting 2nd line treatment with bexarotene together with gabapentin 300 mg daily with the aim of improving pruritus control. Skin progression after 2 months of treatment, as well as insomnia and depression, associated with uncontrollable pruritus, led to start with a 3rd line of treatment, administering polychemotherapy according to the CVP scheme (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone), without doxorubicin due to the comorbidities he presented. Unfortunately, after two cycles of treatment, the patient continued to show no response and no improvement in pruritus. The next available option, extracorporeal photopheresis, was rejected by the reference centre, and in this situation it was decided to administer aprepitant as antipruritic therapy, a use outside the authorised indications. The Pharmacy Department, together with the Haematology Department, reviewed the literature and compared the doses used in the different published case series, starting with a dose of 80 mg daily for 10 days and continuing with 80 mg every 48 hours. Since this was an off-label indication, the patient was asked for informed consent. Each pack of Emend® (aprepitant) contains one 125 mg and two 80 mg doses. Since the dose to be used in this case was 80 mg, in order to make use of the 125 mg capsule, it was decided to prepare a suspension of aprepitant. To this end, the contents of the aprepitant4 capsules (125 mg +80 mg +80 mg +80 mg) were extracted and 7 mL of Ora-Plus® vehicle and another 7 mL of Ora-Sweet® were added, resulting in a 20 mg/mL suspension, which was repacked into 4 mL oral syringes (80 mg). The suspension was given a stability of 90 days, stored in a refrigerator. The patient was given both oral and written information about the days on which to take the treatment, the need for refrigeration and the most common adverse effects. Fifteen days after starting treatment with aprepitant, the patient reported significant improvement in pruritus. So far, pruritus had always been assessed subjectively. It was decided to assess the patient's pruritus using the visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = no pruritus and 10 = worst imaginable pruritus), and the patient was given a VAS of 5. Given the effectiveness of the treatment and the absence of adverse effects, it was decided to continue with the regimen of 80 mg every 48 hours. After one week, the patient was admitted for vesicular lesions and pain in the right hemithorax. During admission, pruritus was well controlled. Gabapentin was also discontinued due to treatment-associated tremors and a 4th line treatment for CTCL (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) was administered. When the patient was discharged from the hospital, he did not take the aprepitant syringes with him by mistake and was off treatment for approximately 1 week. When he returned to the clinic, he reported a worsening of itching, so he restarted treatment with aprepitant. After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, it was decided to discontinue doxorubicin given the progression at cutaneous level. As a last option, weekly gemcitabine was administered, but had to be withdrawn due to poor tolerance. Finally, with a VAS of 9, it was decided to discontinue all chemotherapy and to maintain the best supportive therapy, continuing treatment with aprepitant until the end of the disease.   "
"A 75-year-old man who had previously received complementary intravesical treatment with MMC and BCG. After tumour recurrence, he started treatment with intravesical gemcitabine. During the first instillation, the patient presented intense local burning, dizziness and profuse sweating (grade 2)5, which made it necessary to stop treatment. Although hypotension (90/60 mmHg) occurred post instillation, blood pressure normalised (130/80 mmHg) within a few minutes with postural measures. Dysuria improved over the next 24 hours with oral anti-inflammatory treatment. Urine culture was negative. Treatment was discontinued by patient's decision. After two weeks he started intravesical treatment with MMC with good tolerance after four instillations.  "
"85 year old patient on treatment with moxifloxacin for a respiratory infection admitted for vomiting, diarrhoea and fever of 38.5o C; with hypoalbuminaemia of 2.62 g/dL, serum creatinine (Crs) around 1 mg/dL and a clearance calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation of 38.26 mL/min. A diagnosis of severe and complicated CDI without abdominal distension was made according to the criteria established in the guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CDI3 and intravenous metronidazole 500 mg 3 times a day plus oral vancomycin 500 mg four times a day was prescribed. After 3 days of treatment, trough plasma vancomycin levels of 5.77 μg/mL are detected. This value increases to 10.81 μg/mL on the sixth day of treatment. After 7 days, following resolution of the diarrhoea and a negative stool toxin result, antibiotics are discontinued.   "
"We present the case of a 60-year-old smoker diagnosed with hypothyroidism after thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine and severe OG with bilateral optic neuropathy, classified according to the Clinical Activity Criteria (CAS) with a score of 5 out of 7: pseudophakia in both eyes, inferior punctata OD, palpebral oedema, conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis and caruncle hyperemia and oedema. Visual acuity (VA) was also measured, despite not being included in the CAS criteria for evaluating the capacity of the visual system, obtaining a VA of 0.4 in the right eye (R.O.) and VA of 0.5 in the left eye (L.O.). Normal VA is equal to 1. He started with ocular symptoms 1 year before diagnosis. The aim of treatment was to restore euthyroidism, smoking cessation and disease control by intermittent high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (6 doses of methylprednisolone 500 mg/week, followed by 6 doses of methylprednisolone 250 mg/week). Despite this, little response was obtained and bilateral orbital decompression was necessary due to worsening VA. However, the orbitopathy continued to progress to a VA of finger count in OD and VA less than 0.05 in OI, necessitating a second orbital decompression. Having exhausted all therapeutic possibilities, authorisation for the use of Tocilizumab ""off-label"" in this patient was requested from the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee of our hospital. After obtaining authorisation and informed consent, treatment was started with intravenous Tocilizumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg body weight, once every 4 weeks, for a total of 5 doses. After 2 weeks from the start of treatment, the patient began to show an improvement in the signs and symptoms of the pathology, both subjective and objective, with the VA in the OI at this time being equal to 0.05. At 9 weeks the improvement continued, showing a VA in the LAA equal to 0.1, with almost no signs of oedema and conjunctival and palpebral erythema. At 18 weeks the VA in the LA was equal to 0.6 and after 20 weeks of treatment the VA in the LA reached a value of 1 (normal VA). In the OD, the improvement could not be quantified at that time due to the strabismus present after the decompressions performed, and surgical intervention was pending to resolve this pathology. After 5 sessions with Tocilizumab, the patient has no inflammatory activity and a VA of 0.1 in the OD and VA of 1 in the OI with no adverse effects, with a CAS score of 0 out of 7.   "
"A 71-year-old woman with no past history of interest who, after 6 months of dermatitis on the face, trunk and extremities, was diagnosed in July 2013 by skin biopsy as having DM with skin involvement, without reporting muscle weakness. Muscle enzymes CK and aldolase were normal. ANA positive (1:320) and Mi-1:Mi-2 positive (1:320) with anti-P155/140 negative. Tumour markers and a complete CT scan do not demonstrate the presence of neoplasia. Acute phase reactants are elevated, CRP 44.2 mg/L [0 - 5] and ESR 73 mm/h [0 - 19]. He was treated with prednisone at a dose of 30 mg/24 h in various descending doses for 4 months. During this period, she progressively began to experience myalgia and muscle weakness that forced her to be bedridden, with fever, dysphagia and weight loss of 10 kg. In December 2013, she was admitted on suspicion of DM with the appearance of myopathy. An electromyogram (EMG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and muscle biopsy confirmed inflammatory myopathy in the proximal muscles of the extremities. An oesophagogram confirmed significant oesophageal motor impairment and delayed gastric emptying. She was diagnosed with MD with muscular and digestive involvement, as well as skin involvement. The pulmonary study and echocardiogram were normal. For the first 8 days, corticosteroid therapy prior to admission was maintained. Cinitapride was prescribed as a prokinetic. On the ninth day, after confirming the myopathy, azathioprine 50 mg/24h was started. Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone pulses were added for 3 days, followed by prednisone 30 mg/24h for 2 weeks (then a tapering schedule). On the seventh day after starting azathioprine, GOT/AST 160 U/L [2 - 35] and GPT/ALT 313 U/L [2 - 35] were detected, the previous levels being normal. It was decided to discontinue azathioprine due to hepatotoxicity and the pharmacist reported the suspected adverse reaction to the Pharmacovigilance Centre. Mycophenolate 500 mg/24h is started, for which the patient signs an informed consent form and the documentation for the use of drugs in special situations is completed. The dose was increased to 1 g/12h.  After 6 weeks of treatment, she reported improvement in muscle strength, increased physical activity, significant reduction in dysphagia and dermatitis, with normalisation of acute phase reactants and transaminases, continuing with normal CK and aldolase. It was decided to discontinue cinitapride and continue with a tapering prednisone regimen. After 9 weeks of therapy, she reported hair loss and paresthesia in the lower limbs, which are described as frequent adverse reactions in the mycophenolate data sheet. At week 12 the prednisone dose was lowered from 10 mg to 7.5 mg /24h. At the 14-week follow-up, the patient described a 10-cm pruritic erythematous plaque similar to those seen at the onset of the disease. The only change observed in the laboratory tests was an increase in CRP to 29.2 mg/L. The alopecia stabilised, the paraesthesia disappeared and it was decided to return to 10 mg of prednisone every 24 hours. At week 16, CRP normalised to 4.1 mg/L and the skin condition disappeared, returning to a dose of 7.5 mg /24h of prednisone. At week 20, CRP remained in range and there were no signs of dermatitis, and prednisone 7.5 mg /24h plus 1 g /12h of mycophenolate therapy was considered safe and effective in controlling the disease in this patient.   "
"A 78-year-old man, carpenter, ex-smoker for 22 years, with a history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and ischaemic heart disease due to acute myocardial infarction that required double coronary bypass surgery. The patient underwent surgery for colon neoplasia with the anatomopathological result of stage III adenocarcinoma (pT3pN2M0). Given the patient's pathological history, the use of fluoropyrimidines is not recommended. For this reason, adjuvant chemotherapy treatment was started according to the TOMOX scheme at adjusted doses (raltitrexed 2.5 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). A total of 8 cycles are planned. Tolerance is good. At the follow-up visit prior to the seventh cycle, the patient reported having received antibiotic treatment the previous days for a lower respiratory tract infection diagnosed by his family doctor. He was afebrile, with grade II asthenia and mild deterioration of renal function, so it was decided to postpone the cycle. At that time, the total accumulated doses of raltitrexed and oxaliplatin were 26 mg and 1,040 mg respectively. Forty-eight hours after this last visit, the patient came to the emergency department with a fever of 38.5oC and dyspnoea on minimal effort. Arterial blood gas analysis showed parameters compatible with severe respiratory failure. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and dubious condensation in the right lower lobe. The patient was admitted on suspicion of severe pneumonia, and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation were started. Echocardiography ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism. After 48h, due to respiratory worsening, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), requiring endotracheal intubation. The patient was classified as severe respiratory failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia without isolated germ vs. pulmonary toxicity due to cytostatics associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome. Interactions with the patient's chronic medication were ruled out. The results of microbiological studies (blood and sputum) as well as serology for atypical microorganisms were all negative. Chest CT scan showed a diffuse interstitial pneumonitis component. In view of these results, and given the patient's clinical course, it was decided to initiate high-dose corticosteroid treatment (prednisone 1mg/kg/day), on suspicion of pulmonary toxicity to cytostatics. The patient's evolution was torpid, and he died after 17 days in the ICU.   "
"An 82 year old man came to the Emergency Department for: dyspnoea, increased expectoration and somnolence. Relevant personal history: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Guillen-Barré syndrome and oropharyngeal epidermoid carcinoma T3N0M0 with associated paraneoplastic syndrome of inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), pending the start of radical radiotherapy. His usual treatment consists of acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, silidosin 8 mg and omeprazole 20 mg, all taken once a day; (tolvaptan discontinued after the last admission). The patient was diagnosed with bilo-bar pneumonia due to bronchoaspiration associated with hypoosmolar hyponatraemia (sodium: 101 meq/L (normal range (R.N.) 135-145 meq/L), Osmolality 210 mOsm/kg (R.N. 280-300 mOsm/kg). He presented with severe dysphagia and bleeding associated with pharyngeal tumour, planning gastrostomy and initiating parenteral nutrition via peripheral route, empirical antibiotic treatment with meropenem 1000 mg/8 h and natraemia replacement by serum therapy (252 meq of sodium in 500 mL of 0.9% physiological saline solution every 12 hours); he had normal renal function (MDRD-4 IDMS: > 60 ml/min/1.73m2). On admission to Internal Medicine, clinical and analytical improvement was observed (sodium: 130 meq/L), and the Nephrology Department assessed paraneoplastic SIADH with good response to natraemic replacement by means of serum therapy, which was suspended. Treatment was restarted at low doses of tolvaptan to avoid overcorrection (7.5 mg/24 h) and subsequently increased to the usual dose of 15 mg/24 h. The patient presented with febrile syndrome without a clear focus, and empirical treatment was started with cefepime 2000 mg/12 h, vancomycin 1000 mg/12 h and oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h. Blood cultures were requested, and the results were positive. Blood cultures were requested and were positive for methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermidis, sensitive to vancomycin (MIC = 2 mg/L), so antibiotic treatment was maintained, considering bacteraemia due to catheter, which was withdrawn. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, ruling out endocarditis. Subsequent blood cultures were negative. Three days after starting treatment, the dose of vancomycin was increased to 1250 mg/12 h due to persistent febrile peaks, CRP: 9.6 mg/dL (R.N: 0.0-0.5 mg/dL) and procalcitonin: 4.01 mcg/L (R.N: 0.0-0.5 mcg/L). After two days, new plasma concentrations were extracted and were still lower (8.4 μg/mL) (the possibility of error in the extraction of the sample or in the accuracy and precision of the measurement was assessed), so a pharmacokinetic study was performed to predict the dose by Bayesian estimation, using the PKS® programme (Abbott Base Pharmacokinetic System, Abbott Diagnostics), calculating a t1/2 of 6.4 h and increasing the dose to 1000 mg/8 h. Oral metronidazole 500 mg/8 h was added to the treatment due to persistent Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, and two days later, worsening renal function was observed due to digestive losses, causing pre-renal failure with hyponatraemia (sodium: 115 meq/L), which preceded the elevation of creatinine levels to 2.46 mg/dL and elevation of pre-dose plasma concentrations of vancomycin to 43.1 μg/mL, for which treatment was discontinued. Acute renal failure develops and creatinine values of 5.07 mg/dL are reached in the days following discontinuation of intravenous vancomycin treatment. Nine days after discontinuation, elimination remains very slow, with a t1/2 of 132 h and reaching a plasma concentration of 25.5 μg/mL. Concentrations below the therapeutic range are not reached until 15 days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. The Nephrology Department suspended enteral nutrition to avoid promoting diarrhoea, and performed a new natraemic correction by suspending treatment with tolvaptan, increasing serum therapy and forcing diuresis (approximately 3000 mL/day) to eliminate plasma vancomycin. Vancomycin was administered via gastrostomy due to persistent Clostridium difficile diarrhoea despite treatment with oral metronidazole. Subsequently, the patient presented hypertension, with very abundant diuresis and very positive free water producing hypernatraemia (sodium: 157 meq/L) despite suspension of tolvaptan, so saline solutions were reduced to increase free water. He also presented metabolic acidosis, which was corrected with bicarbonate, and respiratory alkalosis, and a chest X-ray was performed due to suspected left pleural effusion. Due to persistent high plasma concentrations of vancomycin and hypernatremia, serum therapy was readjusted and desmopressin was added. Finally, resolution of the bacteraemia associated with methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermidis, normal haematological formula and afebrile after resolution of the vancomycin intoxication, gradual resolution of the episode of diarrhoea, recovery of renal function and natraemia, reintroduction of enteral diet by gastrostomy and radiotherapy (36 sessions), discontinuation of metronidazole and oral vancomycin.

"A 41-year-old woman diagnosed with RRMS since the age of 29. Given the lack of effectiveness of interferon-beta, it was decided to switch to natalizumab (EDSS 2), without the appearance of new outbreaks during this treatment. This drug was discontinued after two years due to positive VJC serology and, after a four-month washout period (PL) without any pharmacological treatment, it was decided to start fingolimod (EDSS 2). Two months after onset and after radiological stability of the disease for more than two years, three new demyelinating lesions appeared on brain magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with no clinical evidence of a flare-up. Thereafter, the disease was radiologically stable until 28 months later, when the patient suffered a flare-up with an increase in the number of lesions in both semioval centres. Despite the clinical worsening after the resolution of the flare (EDSS 3), the patient continues on fingolimod (30 months from onset to date). Regarding the safety of fingolimod, lymphopenia was evident from baseline (300-900 cells/mmc), not leading to withdrawal.  "
"22-year-old woman, bipulmonary transplanted in March 2014 due to cystic fibrosis. The donor had positive serology for CMV, while the recipient was negative. A few days after transplantation, ganciclovir prophylaxis was started, and later, when the patient tolerated the oral route, valganciclovir was switched to valganciclovir. Viral load controls during prophylaxis were negative in the recipient until the 6th month after transplantation, when viral load was detected in the controls (2,090 IU/ml) without stopping prophylaxis. The patient was admitted to our hospital and started intravenous treatment with ganciclovir; however, one month after starting intravenous therapy, the positive viral load persisted and even increased to 42,400 IU/ml. Due to this, a resistance study was carried out, and it was found to be resistant to ganciclovir, so he was switched to foscarnet. With this drug, the viral load was negatived, but not without certain adverse effects such as hypomagnesaemia. This meant that the immunosuppressive treatment had to be modified, changing cyclosporine for everolimus, as the former can produce the same alteration8. When the viral load became negative with foscarnet, treatment was suspended, with fortnightly check-ups. After two months without treatment, the viral load had increased to 13,665 IU/ml, at which point a request was made to the Pharmacy Service for compassionate use of maribavir, with the intention that the patient would receive oral therapy instead of intravenous therapy. While arrangements were being made to obtain maribavir, the patient started treatment again with oral valganciclovir. Because of the expected delay in obtaining maribavir, and given the urgency of the case, the physicians in charge of the patient considered the off-label use of leflunomide. This request was reported by the Pharmacy Department to the Hospital's Medical Directorate, which authorised the use of leflunomide in this patient. Once leflunomide was available to start treatment, valganciclovir was discontinued. At this time (March 2015) the patient had a viral load of 17,344 IU/mL. The initial regimen was 100 mg daily for the first five days, followed by 20 mg every 12 hours. Fifteen days after starting treatment the viral load had decreased to 531 IU/mL, becoming undetectable within a month. Six months after starting leflunomide the patient maintained an undetectable viral load with no adverse drug effects.   "
"A 52-year-old man, weighing 240 kg and with a BMI of 74 kg/m2, was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of ischaemic stroke. As pathological history of interest, the patient had presented in the past with deep vein thromboembolism, for which reason he was prescribed anticoagulant therapy at home with Rivaroxaban. The Emergency Department suggested the possibility of fibrinolytic treatment with alteplase. However, after examination, this intervention was rejected, as the patient was at the limit of the time interval, had 23 points on the NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) and the time of the last intake of Rivaroxaban was unknown. After admission to the ICU for monitoring and neurological surveillance, it was decided to start treatment with enoxaparin as anticoagulant therapy. For this purpose, the Intensive Care Medicine Department contacted the Pharmacy Department to find out the most appropriate dosage given the patient's extreme obesity2 (BMI > 40 kg/m2). For safety reasons, given the scarcity of data on the subject, it was decided to start treatment at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/12 h subcutaneously (enoxaparin 160 mg/12 h) to avoid bleeding and as this was the maximum dose evaluated in various clinical trials3-5. 3-5 In addition, monitoring of anti-Xa factor was established to establish the final dose.  Four hours after administration of the third dose, the anti-Xa factor concentration in blood was 0.37 IU/mL. When it was between 0.35-0.49 IU/mL, the dose was increased by ≈10% (170 mg/12 h). Four hours after the next dose, the anti-Xa factor concentration was 0.59 IU/mL, and at 24 hours it was 0.48 IU/mL. In view of this result, the dose was increased, reaching 180 mg/12 h. Finally, the next determination obtained a value of 0.84 IU/mL, placing us within the therapeutic range and setting the optimal dose for our patient at 0.75 mg/kg/12 h.   "
"A 27-year-old man came to an internal medicine clinic referred by his primary care doctor for: asthenia of three months' duration, non-specific dizziness and intermittent epigastralgia of moderate intensity. Relevant personal history: allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. His usual treatment consisted of ebastine 10 mg once daily during the seasonal allergy period. Examination revealed marked pallor of the skin and mucous membranes. Blood tests showed haemoglobin 6.5 g/dL (13-18 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume 125 fl (80-100 fl), leucocytes 6,000/mL (4,000-10,500/mL), platelets 280,000/mm3 (150. 000-400,000/mm3, total bilirubin 1.35 mg/dL (0.3-1.2 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 140 IU/L (4-50 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 410 IU/L (5-47 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 4,186 IU/L (140-240 IU/L). In view of this analysis, a blood smear was requested which showed anisocytosis with a macrocytic tendency, hypersegmentation of neutrophils and some dacryocytes. Iron and folic acid levels were normal, with serum vitamin B12 levels of 62 pg/mL (180880 pg/mL) and homocysteine of 32 μmol (4-15 μmol/L). Gastrin levels are clearly elevated 539 pg/mL (normal < 100 pg/mL). Treatment was started with intramuscular injections of 1,000 μg/day of vitamin B12 for 7 days, then weekly for one month and maintenance therapy with one injection per month. The haemogram normalised in the fourth week of treatment.   "
"We present the case of a 39-year-old female patient, 59 kg and 160 cm tall, with a history of four spontaneous abortions of seven to ten weeks with a live embryo. The sterility studies she had undergone were within normal limits, except for a diagnosis of heterozygous Factor V Leiden6. This alteration results in a variant of human coagulation factor V that frequently causes an inherited hypercoagulability disorder, most commonly among Eurasians. In these cases, the factor V Leiden variant cannot be inactivated by activated protein C. In pregnant women with this abnormality, prophylactic administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at therapeutic doses adjusted per kg of body weight is recommended as soon as gestation is diagnosed and up to 6-8 weeks postpartum. It should be noted that in the last gestation the patient experienced a miscarriage despite being treated with LMWH, so the haematological origin of these miscarriages is ruled out. With the previous obstetric history (G4P0A4), the patient began a new pregnancy with a therapeutic regimen of LMWH enoxaparin 40 mg/24 h, as soon as she was aware of this. At five weeks the patient underwent an immunological study. The results showed NK cell values above normal, with 18% of peripheral NK cells and 95% of them with CD56+CD16 expression (17% of the lymphocytes). According to the algorithm proposed by Ramos-Medina3 et al. for the patient's age, these values imply a high risk of presenting an immunological alteration associated with reproductive failure. Based on the study carried out, they conclude that: a percentage of NK cells > 18% is the best variable for discriminating women with reproductive failure, and for women over 35 years of age, CD56+CD16 cell values above 13% define a special subgroup of patients with a high risk of pregnancy loss (100%). Off-label use of this drug is requested. After authorisation by the centre's management and the signature of the pregnant woman on the informed consent form, the administration of the IGs regimen described in the literature was started. It starts with GIs 400 mg/kg body weight, every four weeks, from the knowledge of week 4 to week 13, once a month; then 200 mg/kg monthly until week 36, since it has been shown that GIs cross the placenta more intensively after the third trimester. After two doses of IGs, a new immunological study is requested, showing a reduction of NK cells to 8% with 90% CD56+CD16 markers (7.2% of lymphocytes). Figure 1.  Treatment was administered according to schedule with no incidents or relevant adverse effects with respect to the established IG regimen. At week 40 + 1 the pregnant woman had a live birth by elective caesarean section. She was switched to a thromboprophylactic regimen of LMWH the day before the operation and discontinued the same day. The therapeutic dose is restarted at 12-24 hours and continued for two months.   "
"A 64-year-old male patient diagnosed in May 2014 with subcardial gastric adenocarcinoma with involvement of the oesophagogastric junction in stage IV (following ascitic fluid cytology that was positive for malignancy). The first line of treatment was EOX: epirubicin 91.5 mg (50 mg/m2) + oxaliplatin 237.9 mg (130 mg/m2) every 21 days intravenously + oral capecitabine (650 mg/12 h). After the administration of four cycles of chemotherapy, a clinical improvement was observed which, after radiological confirmation, led to surgery. He underwent a total gastrectomy, with excision of a liver cyst and cholecystectomy. One month later he required a second operation for biliary leakage and one month later he needed a transparietal drainage due to a collection in the right hypochondrium. The patient suffered a recurrence three months after undergoing gastrectomy (four and a half months after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy), so it was requested, in the context of an expanded use programme, to start a second line of treatment with cycles, every 14 days, of paclitaxel 137 mg (80 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 + ramucirumab 496 mg (8 mg/kg) on day 1, intravenously. In February 2015 he started ramucirumab and after one month he received six subcutaneous doses of 300 mcg of filgrastim (two consecutive weekly doses for three weeks). Five months after treatment, she was admitted to hospital with fever of unknown origin, probably tumour-related, and received naproxen (500 mg/12h orally) and dexamethasone (4 mg/12h intravenously) for 2 days. Two days after discharge she received cycle 12 of ramucirumab with paclitaxel and again came to the emergency department reporting abdominal pain with abrupt onset and rectorrhagia after administration of the cycle. An abdominal computed axial tomography (CAT) scan diagnosed splenic rupture and oesophagojejunal perianastomotic fistula. He underwent emergency splenectomy and drainage of the fistula. During admission, he evolved torpidly due to several adjacent intra-abdominal collections and bilateral pleural effusion, requiring palliative care at home after being discharged one and a half months after admission. The patient suffered two repeated admissions for bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism and respiratory infection which was treated with levofloxacin, 500 mg per day, and poorly controlled abdominal pain. Following a new abdominal CT scan and with an elevated tumour marker (CA 19.9), he was diagnosed with intestinal obstruction secondary to peritoneal carcinomatosis, and was treated in the Palliative Care Unit. Given the patient's deteriorating condition, transfer to the Palliative Care Hospital was requested, where he died in the following months.   "
"A 50-year-old man weighing 79 kg with HCV cirrhosis (genotype 1b/fibroscan 22.6 KPa) diagnosed 20 years ago, with splenomegaly, portal hypertension and leukothrombocytopenia. History of injecting drug addiction with no methadone substitution treatment at present. In 2009, treatment with interferon was ineffective. Other medical and family history of no relevance. In July 2015 he started treatment with Viekirax®, Exviera® and Rebetol®, 1,200 mg per day for 12 weeks, without any concomitant treatment. Two weeks later, she went to the doctor and reported good tolerance. By the fourth week, the viral load was negative, but the patient reported skin lesions, a change in character, aggressiveness and suicidal thoughts, so both he and his family asked to discontinue treatment and he was referred to psychiatry. In December 2015, the patient came to the clinic with a report from Psychiatry stating that he had not been prescribed any psychopharmaceuticals and that at that time there was no contraindication to starting another HCV treatment. In February 2016, treatment was started with ledipasvir 90 mg/sofosbuvir 400 mg (Harvoni®) and Rebetol® 1,200 mg for 12 weeks. At the fourth week, the patient reported good tolerance and the viral load was negative. At the twelfth week, the patient successfully completed the treatment.   "
"A 75-year-old man with a history of hyperuricaemia treated with Allopurinol was admitted for transurethral resection of the prostate. Immediate postoperative period was uneventful with treatment with Pantoprazole, Ciprofloxacin, Paracetamol, Enantyum and Allopurinol. On the fourth postoperative day he presented dizziness, tremor with a myoclonic component in the limbs and trunk and inability to walk, with no laboratory alterations. In this situation, Rivotril was prescribed and treatment with Ciprofloxacin was discontinued, the myoclonic symptoms disappeared and the patient's condition improved, and he was discharged from hospital.

"84-year-old woman with a diagnosis of depression; severe colonic diverticulosis; vertebral crushing D8-D10; vitamin D deficiency; arterial and pulmonary hypertension; atrial flutter and mitral, tricuspid and aortic insufficiency, on treatment with sertraline (50 mg/day v.o.), furosemide (40 mg/day v.o.), furosemide (40 mg/day v.o.), furosemide (40 mg/day v.o.) and furosemide (40 mg/day v.o.). ), furosemide (40 mg/day v.o.), bisoprolol (5 mg/day v.o.), acenocoumarol according to haematology guidelines, omeprazole (20 mg/day v.o.), simvastatin (20 mg/day v.o.), simvastatin (20 mg/day v.o.) and omeprazole (20 mg/day v.o.). ), simvastatin (20 mg/day v.o.), lormetazepam (1 mg/day v.o.), vitamin D (1 ampoule v.o./month), domperidone (10 ml/8 hours v.o.) and home oxygen therapy. In January 2016, she was admitted to the hospital emergency department for an episode of haematochezia, where she was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary pathology. A computed axial tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed extensive bilateral parenchymal pulmonary infiltrates, a calcified granuloma in the middle lobe of the lung and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (15x20 mm). On suspicion of bilateral multi-lobar community-acquired pneumonia, she was prescribed clarithromycin (500 mg/day v.o.) and was discharged from hospital. In February 2016, the patient was admitted to the internal medicine department for dyspnoea and for the study of pulmonary infiltrates that had not subsided since hospital discharge despite antibiotic treatment. During admission, a Mantoux test and bronchoscopy were performed, both with negative results, in addition to a CT scan showing bilateral airspace condensation, an interlobular adenopathy (15 mm) of possible malignant origin, several irregular nodules and a calcified nodule (6.2 mm). It was decided to withdraw treatment with sertraline and clarithromycin and the tests were repeated two weeks later, with results showing a decrease in pulmonary infiltrates and less air condensation. The patient experienced both objective and subjective clinical improvement and was discharged from the hospital. Five days after discharge, the patient restarted treatment with sertraline on the advice of her primary care physician in the event of a possible recurrence of the depressive symptoms. The patient returned to the emergency department in March 2016 for dyspnoea on slight exertion and oppressive central thoracic pain that increased with deep inspiration. Pulmonary auscultation revealed a vesicular murmur with crackles in the right base. He was readmitted to internal medicine, where a chest X-ray revealed the presence of smaller pulmonary infiltrates than in the previous admission. It was decided to withdraw sertraline for a second time, and the patient recovered her autonomous capacity, her dyspnoea and chest pain disappeared, and her oxygen saturation increased to 93%. Two weeks after discontinuation of sertraline treatment, a control chest X-ray was performed, confirming the decrease in the extent of pulmonary infiltrates. It should be noted that during the whole period the patient had eosinophil levels within the normal range. The patient's clinical evolution allowed definitive discontinuation of treatment with sertraline, simvastatin, omeprazole, domperidone and vitamin D, maintaining the rest of the medication.   "
"A thirteen year old woman presented with fever for 12 days accompanied by left axillary adenopathy. Initial examination was negative except for scratches on the left hand. Initial laboratory data included: leukocytes 4,700 (32% lymphocytes; 9% monocytes and 51% granulocytes); ESR 14 mm/h; CRP 2.4 mg/dl; negative blood culture. Given the persistence of fever and the presence of lymphadenopathy, Cat Scratch Disease was suspected, serology for Bartonella henselae was performed and treatment with rifampicin was started, with the fever disappearing 3 days after starting treatment. Subsequently, the diagnosis was confirmed when the serology was positive for Bartonella henselae.  "
"A 64-year-old man came to the PC clinic for a dry cough of two months' duration and an occasional sensation described by the patient: as if his pylorus was ""closing up"" and he was unable to eat. His family history included the death of his mother and father from tuberculosis (TB). His personal history included: poliomyelitis in childhood, which left a slight deformity in both lower limbs, duodenal ulcus at the age of 35 with no subsequent peptic symptoms, and inguinal herniorrhaphy in 1997. He had been an ex-smoker for 9 years. In the anamnesis, he initially reported occasional retrosternal heartburn lasting minutes, which subsided spontaneously or with antacids, and also a feeling of gastric fullness. Physical examination revealed an asthenic habitus. He was afebrile, eupnoeic and normal colour. Examination of the head, neck, chest and abdomen was normal. At the first visit, his family doctor ordered basic laboratory tests (haemogram and biochemistry) and a chest X-ray and prescribed empirical treatment with omeprazole 20 mg/day. The results of the complementary tests were strictly normal and the empirical treatment was not effective. Simultaneously, the patient consulted an otorhinolaryngologist on his own initiative, who requested an X-ray of the paranasal sinuses, which revealed findings compatible with sinusitis that was treated by the specialist with a course of Cefuroxime-axetil 500 mg/12 h (6 days). Subsequently, one month later, given the persistence of the cough and the recent appearance of a discreet weight loss, her family doctor requested an interconsultation with the pulmonologist, who performed an extended analytical analysis and a faecal occult blood test, looking for pulmonary and digestive pathology. The pulmonologist performed the following complementary tests: mantoux test, which was positive (12 mm) with sputum and urine Ziehl's test repeatedly negative, baseline arterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests (PFT) and methacholine challenge test, fibrobronchoscopy, and thoracic computed tomography (CT). All these tests yielded no pathological findings. Empirical treatment with bronchodilators prescribed by the pulmonologist was also ineffective. The new complementary tests performed by the family doctor showed mild anaemia (Hb: 11.7 g/dl), normochromic normochromic normocytic anaemia with high red blood cell distribution index, thrombocytosis, increased globulins, decreased albumin and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 88 mm/hour. The faecal occult blood test was positive. With this new finding, her family doctor requested a consecutive consultation with the gastroenterologist, who performed a colonoscopy and an opaque enema in which the only significant finding was colonic diverticulosis, with no evidence of other digestive pathology. Simultaneously with the follow-up of the digestive symptoms, 3 weeks after the consultation with the pulmonologist, the patient began to suffer from asthenia and his family doctor requested a consultation with the hospital's Internal Medicine Department. At this department, an abdominal CT scan was performed showing a large abdominal tumour with probable gastric organ-dependence and local involvement, which was confirmed by gastroscopy and biopsy. During oral panendoscopy, a pre-pyloric gastric ulcer of benign appearance was found, which was later confirmed by pathological anatomy of a biopsy specimen. The General and Digestive Surgery Department performed an exploratory laparotomy and found a large tumour, probably retroperitoneal, attached to the posterior gastric wall at the level of the fundus and multiple extraperitoneal nodules. Several of these nodules were removed for biopsy and a partial gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy was performed. The biopsy was reported as an intermediate grade spindle cell sarcoma (grade II), which could be classified as a stromal sarcoma of the gastrointestinal wall. With this diagnosis, he was referred to the internal medicine department for evaluation of adjuvant treatment, which was rejected. After discharge from hospital, the patient received home care with palliative treatment by his family doctor until his death, fourteen months after diagnosis.  "
"This is a 21-year-old woman, with no previous history of interest, who initially consulted the emergency department of her health centre due to odynophagia and fever, was diagnosed with acute pharyngitis, and was prescribed treatment with oral amoxicillin for a week. Once the treatment was completed, the patient visited her primary care physician, reporting a remission of fever but persistent odynophagia, which she related to a lesion on the left lateral edge of the tongue. Examination revealed an ulcerated lesion, whitish in colour, approximately 1 cm in diameter, on the lateral edge of the tongue, about 3.4 cm from the tip. No lymphadenopathy or other oropharyngeal lesions were found. The lesion was labelled as a lingual aphthous ulcer, in the context of a post-infectious condition, and symptomatic treatment was prescribed to alleviate the discomfort. After 15 days, the lesion did not improve, and on re-interrogation of the patient it was found that the lesion may have preceded the infectious condition, with these data the patient was referred for a biopsy of the lesion. The intraoperative biopsy diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma that reached the surgical edge. The microscopic description showed an ulcerated neoformation that infiltrated deep to the vicinity of the deep resection edge without reaching it. The neoformation consists of epithelial cells arranged in nests or cords. These cells have a low mitotic index and have a tendency to form horny globes. The diagnosis is well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating to the vicinity of the surgical resection margin. Subsequently, a biopsy of a cervical fibroadipose fragment containing 25 lymph nodes was performed and all 25 were negative for tumour cells. The patient underwent surgery where a functional neck dissection and a left hemiglossectomy was performed using CO2 laser. The evolution was satisfactory, being asymptomatic up to the present time and with no signs of recurrence.  "
"As part of the activity of the Basic Prevention Unit of the Osakidetza Alav University Hospital, medical consultations are carried out at the request of the workers. The worker, a 41-year-old administrative assistant, first came to our Unit on 4 December 2013. The symptoms she presented with were a cough, especially at night, sneezing, a feeling of fatigue, with no fever or accompanying expectoration. She also reported a frontal headache with tension features. The cough and feeling of fatigue had been present for several weeks. Personal history: allergy to mites, grasses and animal epithelium. She smoked 20 cigarettes/day, with a high level of dependence (according to the Fagerstrom test). She did not take any medication, nor did she have any other additional pathology, except that a few years ago she had presented papular, pinkish lesions on her fingers, which were assessed by Dermatology as Granuloma annulare and treated with topical corticoids. It should be noted that she had a pet cat, which she could not do without. On examination, cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal, with no signs of neurological involvement. Initially, it was thought to be an allergic condition, probably related to the cat's epithelium. Treatment was prescribed with inhaled bronchodilators and analgesics for her headache, and she was scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 10 days. The worker improved substantially with the bronchodilator and did not attend a check-up. When she stopped the bronchodilators on her own initiative, she again presented with coughing and a more pronounced sensation of dyspnoea. She returned to our clinic one month after the initial visit, with similar coughing symptoms and a feeling of fatigue, with a normal cardiopulmonary examination, so spirometry and chest X-ray were requested. The spirometry performed on the worker was strictly normal. The chest X-ray requested showed images of millimetric nodules predominantly in both upper fields, which were not present in the patient's chest X-ray of February 2012. A high-resolution CAT scan (HRCT) was requested, and at the same time a consultation was made with Pneumology, completing the study with CO2 diffusion tests and pulmonary flow curve.  The CAT scan showed bilateral pulmonary involvement, predominantly in the upper fields, with thickening of the bronchial walls. Scattered nodules, some cavitated inside, giving rise to cystic images.  The CO2 diffusion tests and pulmonary flow curve were within normal parameters. Complete blood tests were carried out and ANCA and ANA were negative. Given the radiological findings described in the CT scan and the smoking habit, the initial diagnostic suspicion was of Histiocytosis X, so it was decided to refer for confirmation by lung biopsy, for which a bronchoscopy was performed and samples were taken using the cryobiopsy technique. The cryobiopsy probe is located 1-2 cm from the pleura using fluoroscopy.  The cryoprobe used is a flexible probe with a diameter of 2.4mm, which is connected to the cryotherapy equipment. The freezing of the tissue to which the probe is applied results from the decompression of the gas (nitrous oxide) at the end of the probe, which allows the extraction of a traction-stable sample. As with transbronchial biopsies, the probe is introduced through the bronchoscope and cold is applied for 3 seconds. The difference to the traditional clamp technique is that in this case sedation of the patient is required, which on the other hand provides greater comfort and better tolerance. Emphysema changes and intra-alveolar accumulations of histiocytes with fine brownish cytoplasmic pigmentation associated with hyperplastic pneumocytes are described.  Immunohistochemistry showed nodular clusters of CD1-positive cells, compatible with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.   "
"This is a 75-year-old woman with a history of type II DM under insulin treatment with chronic complications such as polyneuropathy, HTN under treatment and obese, who is scheduled for PTR (total knee replacement) surgery. The anaesthetic technique was a combined epidural/intradural procedure at L3-L4 level, 3 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% without vasoconstrictor was administered through the intradural needle and an epidural catheter was left in place for postoperative analgesia. The postoperative period was uneventful and she went upstairs with a PCAE (epidural PCA) loaded with bupivacaine 0.125 and fentanyl 4 micrograms per ml, with a schedule of 3 ml.h-1, 3 ml boluses every 30 minutes. At approximately 4 a.m. the PCA was changed, causing the error and administering via epidural a PCA with medication and programming for i.v. (in 100 ml, 50 mg of fentanyl every 30 minutes). (in 100 ml, 50 mg of morphine plus 10 g of metamizole). At the time of the daily visit to the PACU, the nurse of the PACU detects the error. The patient is conscious and oriented with excellent analgesia, with no evidence of respiratory depression, neurological alterations or other side effects. The amount of drug administered was 4 mg morphine and 160 mg metamizole. The PCA and catheter were removed and the patient was admitted to the Resuscitation Unit for control and follow-up, where she did not present any side effects and remained stable at all times. 24 hours later, she was discharged to the ward and 2 weeks later she was discharged home, after a review by the anaesthesiologist. Periodic follow-up was carried out for up to 18 months without any incidence.  "
"A 19-year-old patient who had undergone caesarean section two years previously due to suspected chorioamnionitis. She then began with fever and night sweats without affecting her general condition, and a large mediastinal mass was found on chest X-ray. Following mediastinoscopy and biopsy, a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma nodular sclerosis type, stage III-IV due to infradiaphragmatic adenopathic involvement and hepatosplenomegaly was made. Chemotherapy was started according to the ABVD scheme to complete nine cycles, followed by radiotherapy on the mediastinum. One year later, disease was again detected in the mediastinum and lung parenchyma together with hepatosplenomegaly. For the last month he has been suffering moderate pain treated with paracetamol, 3,000 mg/day-1 and metamizol 1,500 mg/day-1. It was decided to start a new line of chemotherapy with ESCHAP. Systematically, at the beginning of the chemotherapy cycles and during the following 5-7 days, the patient suffered intense mediastinal and dorsal interscapular pain that did not subside with oral morphine or fentanyl TD, relieved only with parenteral morphine, 10 mg s.c., which provided her with analgesia of irregular duration, between 4 and 12 hours. This occurred during the previous cycle of chemotherapy and after a first cycle of the ESCHAP scheme. In view of the poor peripheral routes, vascular portal placement was proposed, which was approached via the right subclavian route. We took advantage of this circumstance to plan PCA with an external pump during and after the chemotherapy cycles, through the vascular portal. Monitoring consisted of continuous EKG in DII lead, pulse oximetry and blood pressure measurement by oscillometry every five minutes. The procedure was performed under local anaesthesia and sedation with 2 mg intravenous midazolam, using the Seldinger technique. The right subclavian vein was approached below the junction between the distal third and the midclavicular third with satisfactory progression of the guidewire and subsequent blood aspiration. Antero-posterior (A-P) radiological control was carried out to verify correct placement. Chemotherapy was then started. Twenty-four hours after starting chemotherapy, the patient reported chest pain and intense dyspnoea, with tachycardia, tachypnoea and abolition of vesicular murmur in the right hemithorax on examination. Chest X-ray showed massive right pleural effusion, with a catheter tip outside the right atrium in the pleural cavity.  In view of the suspected extravasation of a chemotherapy substance in the pleura, a diagnostic puncture was performed, obtaining serous pleural fluid with the same biochemical characteristics as the chemotherapy used. The patient's radiological series was reviewed and the tip of the venous catheter was observed to migrate until it was located at pleural level, possibly between the two blades, resulting in secondary drainage of the infused liquid into the pleural space.  It was decided to place an endopleural drainage after evacuating thoracentesis by thoracic surgery, extracting 2,000 cc of serous content. Clinical improvement was immediate. Seventy-two hours later, the pleural drain was removed and a new central venous access was placed via the left subclavian approach, without incident, through which chemotherapy treatment was resumed.  "
"A 32-year-old primigravida, 38 weeks' gestation, admitted to hospital for rupture of membranes. Her personal history included Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, with involvement of the right lower limb, in which an increase in diameter and length could be observed, with the presence of a flat angioma on the anteroexternal side of the thigh, striking venous varicosities, both on the thigh and right leg, and trophic skin disorders that mainly affected the distal area of the leg. Followed up by the vascular surgery service, she did not receive any medical treatment, except for local topical products for the care of the skin disorders on her right leg. She provided a report describing the lesions that the patient presented; it also excluded the involvement of the contralateral lower limb, as well as the existence of vascular malformations at other levels. She had not presented any complications as a consequence of her underlying disease, with the exception of skin involvement due to circulatory stasis. The patient requested epidural analgesia for labour; at that time she had 3 cm of cervical dilatation, there was effective uterine dynamics and the foetus was reactive, with no evidence of foetal distress. Laboratory data showed a haemogram with platelets 136,000, haemoglobin 10.9, with the rest of the parameters being normal; the coagulation study and basic biochemistry were normal. After signing the consent form and explanation of the procedure, it was decided to place a 20G epidural catheter using an 18G Tuohy needle at the level of the L3-L4 space, and the technique was performed without incident. Test doses of 5 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine and an initial bolus of 8 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% without vasoconstrictor and 100 mg of fentanyl were administered without incident. Bupivacaine 0.0625% was perfused with 2 µg.ml-1 of fentanyl, between 15-20 ml.h-1, achieving very satisfactory analgesia until the end of labour. Euthocic delivery was achieved, which required episiotomy, and the product of gestation was a male newborn weighing 2,695 g, with an Apgar test of 9-10. In the immediate postpartum period, the epidural catheter was removed without incident. At 12 h after delivery, and taking into account the high risk of thromboembolic phenomena, low molecular weight heparin was administered s.c., prophylactically as indicated by obstetrics, without incident. This treatment was maintained until the patient was discharged on the 3rd postpartum day. The patient was assessed 24 hours after delivery and telephoned one week after hospital discharge, without any incident and/or complication related to epidural analgesia. The degree of satisfaction with the analgesic technique used was optimal.  "
"Patient aged 13 years and 11 months with a personal history of thyroglossal cyst operated on at the age of 2 years, obesity under study, who manifested since 2 months before admission: asthenia, headache, anorexia, frequent epistaxis and tachycardia after physical exercise. Examination revealed cutaneous and mucosal pallor, laterocervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly measuring 6 cm and hepatomegaly measuring 2 cm. Various complementary examinations were requested, including the following: Ht: 28.3%; Hb: 7.2 g/dl; leukocytes: 235,600 mm3 (L 83.8%, M 1.1%, N 2%, E 0.1%, B 7.9%); platelets: 24,000 mm3; ESR: 70 mm/h; LDH: 1,686 U/l; uric acid: 8.3 mg/dl; ferritin: 151 ng/dl. In view of the patient's clinical and analytical evolution, a haematological neoplastic process was suspected and a bone marrow aspirate was performed in which 97% of blasts were observed, with marrow infiltration of blast elements. After completing the cytogenetic, molecular, serological, microbiological and immunological studies, a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), FAB type L2 was made. Chemotherapy was started according to the SHOP 99 protocol for very high-risk patients, obtaining complete remission at the end of the induction phase. Four months after the consolidation phase, the patient relapses, and the fourth phase of treatment, maintenance therapy, is required to keep the child in remission. The treatment of ALL is carried out according to established protocols (4), with the child often having to undergo multiple lumbar punctures for chemotherapy administration and spinal cord aspiration for disease control throughout the disease treatment process (5). After obtaining parental consent and explanation of the treatment to the child, sites for lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration were chosen. The patient was premedicated with midazolam (Dormicum®) 5 mg v.o. and OTFC transmucosal oral fentanyl citrate (Actiq®) 400 mcg v.o., and an EMLA® cream dressing was placed on the puncture sites. Oxygen was administered through nasal goggles at 4 l/m, and the electrocardiogram, capnography, pulse oximetry and blood pressure were monitored from the beginning of the procedure until discharge from the post-anaesthesia recovery unit, according to the recommendations of the Spanish Society of Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation.  After 30 minutes, the skin of the puncture site was infiltrated with 2-5 ml of 1% lidocaine and then treatment was started. On all occasions (4 lumbar punctures and 1 bone aspiration puncture), these could be performed without complications and were well tolerated by the patient. The pain rating according to the Visual Analogue Scale was 2.8 mm (0-10) and according to the verbal categorical scale 1 (0-4). The overall assessment of the efficacy of analgesic treatment was 'good' in all situations, except on the day of lumbar and spinal puncture, which was rated as 'fair'. The parameters monitored during the procedure were within normal limits. There was no nausea, vomiting or pruritus, and the patient was discharged to the ward 60 minutes after the procedure.   "
"45-year-old male, with no known drug allergies. Personal history: ex-smoker (more than 30 packs/year), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, a history of circulating antiphospholipid antibody with a history of two deep vein thrombosis. Within his pre-admission vascular history: in October 2004 he had a left iliac stent plus a left-right femoral-femoral by-pass. In February 2005 he underwent dilatation with cryotherapy of the left iliac, which was not effective, so he underwent a femoro-popliteal by-pass to the first portion of the left lower limb. In February 2006 he was admitted again to the vascular surgery department due to short claudication. In a first operation, a bilateral femoral-ileal by-pass was performed with placement of an epidural catheter for post-surgical analgesia. The postoperative period was not satisfactory, so three days later, a new operation was performed: common femoral by-pass with internal saphenous vein in the left leg. After 24 hours of evolution, the epidural catheter was lost and intravenous analgesia was prescribed at that time. Four days later the evolution was not adequate, with an ischaemic foot, cold toes, signs of prenecrosis, together with intense pain requiring treatment with transdermal fentanyl, rescue with 5 mg boluses of subcutaneous morphic chloride every hour and oral corticoids (prednisone 60 mg/day), suspecting the possibility of small vessel micro-infarcts and considering the possibility of amputation of the anterior third of the foot, given the bad situation. Consultation with the anaesthesiology department (Pain Unit) was requested, which rejected the placement of a new epidural catheter, as the patient was on therapy with oral anticoagulants. It was decided to place a sciatic catheter (Stimulong-plus Plexos Cateter set 19 G-100 mm by Pajunk®), which was performed in the operating theatre, with neurostimulation and via the proximal posterior gluteal route (Labat technique). Perfusion with bupivacaine 0.37 % at 3-5 ml/hour is then started. Two days later the foot looks much better. Six days after catheter placement she began to walk, losing the sciatic catheter three days later, at which point she was switched to intravenous analgesia. She was discharged 2 days later with a satisfactory evolution.   "
"Female patient, 68 years old, right-handed, married, occupation: home. Condition that began 4 years prior to her arrival at the pain clinic, characterised by pain in the left maxillary region of a sharp type, very intense, with periods free of pain although with a sensation of ""traction"", without other irradiations, initially lasting for seconds an average of 4 times a day, without sensory alterations. Initially treated by neurologist with carbamazepine 200 mg c-8 hrs. Two years later the pain increased and also began to appear in the frontal and periorbital region on the same side, adding electric touch pain, which was predominant, and for this reason gabapentin 300 mg c-12 hrs was added. She had no previous history of importance. The initial physical examination was essentially normal. He had an unaltered cranial CT scan and cranial MRI. Treatment was started with carbamazepine 200 mg c-8 hrs and amitriptyline 25 mg c-24 hrs and analgesic block was applied to the left infraorbital nerve. She maintained a 20% improvement, however, her symptoms increased and she subsequently presented cervical pain. On re-exploration, pain was found in the spinous processes of C3-C4, X-rays showed signs of cervical osteoarthrosis and a block was performed at both levels on the left side with 1% lidocaine and pure alcohol, with a 70% improvement in symptoms. The patient continues medical treatment with adequate control after 5 years.  "
"A 39-year-old woman diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome type I of the right upper extremity, with a previous history of two arthroscopic surgeries on that shoulder. The last surgery presented as a complication an infection caused by pseudomonas which was successfully treated. The patient complained of moderate to severe burning pain every day in her right upper extremity, which did not respond to conventional analgesic treatments. Associated with this she presented oedema, colour changes and trophic changes in this extremity. Apart from CRPS, the patient was in good general health, neurologically normal, without hypertension or diabetes. It was decided to perform a stellate ganglion block, for which intravenous access was established and the patient was monitored with electrocardiogram, blood pressure and O2 saturation. The block was performed by paratracheal approach using a 3.5 cm long needle with 10 ml of procaine 1% without epinephrine; the cricoid cartilage was palpated to discern the C6 level. The transverse process of the sixth vertebra was palpated between the trachea and the carotid sheath. Prior to the injection, aspiration was performed in order to rule out puncture of any vascular structure; the aspiration was negative. After the block, the patient presented Horner's syndrome. Five minutes after the block, the patient manifested malaise, dizziness and severe headache. The patient's blood pressure increased from 135/80 to 235/135 mmHg, with sinus tachycardia. The hypertension was relieved by administration of intravenous metoprolol in fractional doses, bringing the blood pressure down to 140/90 mmHg. After vital signs were restored to normal levels, the patient complained of dizziness and fatigue accompanied by headache and hiccups, for which she was hospitalised. An ECG, neurological examination and a cranial CT scan were performed and revealed no abnormalities. Thyroid tests were also performed to exclude thyrotoxicosis, which were normal. A few days later the patient returned to the clinic and reported weakness and a 'back and forth movement of the head' which had no medical explanation. The 'movement' disappeared two months later without the need for medication.   "
"A 68 year old female patient, who came to the pain clinic referred by her GP, diagnosed with severe spondyloarthrosis, mainly at the expense of the lumbar spine. She had been prescribed generic transdermal fentanyl 25 μg/h for 2 weeks, with regular pain control (VAS, 7-8). After examination of the patient, the exchange of generic fentanyl for Durogesic® Matrix 25 μg/h was considered. After 2 weeks, the patient presented better pain control (VAS, 3-4), requiring 1 g paracetamol on its own as a rescue treatment. At 3 months she continues with Durogesic® Matrix 25 μg/h, with acceptable pain control (VAS, 3), and sporadically, as a rescue, paracetamol 1 g.  "
"A 61 year old male patient, who is being assessed for clinical pain due to grade III obliterating arteriopathy with involvement of the lower limbs. He has been prescribed Durogesic® Matrix 50 μg/h as analgesic treatment for 18 months with acceptable pain control (VAS, 3-4). As rescue medication she is using paracetamol 1 g, (maximum 1 or 2 per day). She came for an emergency visit to the pain unit because for the last 15 days she has had an increased pain threshold with a certain state of agitation and nervousness. All this occurred after seeing his GP for medication, who prescribed generic transdermal fentanyl 50 μg/h, requiring paracetamol 1 g every 6 h as a rescue, with little pain relief, increasing the VAS to 7-8. After anamnesis with the patient, we again prescribe Durogesic® Matrix 50 μg/h. When the patient was reviewed after 2 weeks, he again presented better pain relief, with VAS of 3-4 again, and the nervousness that he had previously presented disappeared. Currently, 3 months after the last visit, the patient continues with Durogesic® Matrix 50 μg/h and, sporadically, paracetamol 1g.  "
"A 65 year old man with a spinal cord stimulation electrode (MES) system to control pain secondary to ischaemia due to peripheral artery disease and induction of vasodilatation. Despite therapeutic efforts, the poor evolution of the disease led to the amputation of the right lower limb in November 1998. The following month, the patient began to report symptoms compatible with phantom limb pain. Double anticonvulsant therapy, antidepressants and minor analgesics and adjustment of EEM parameters were started. The pain was partially controlled, but episodes of lancinating pain persisted with visual analogue scale (VAS) = 8. In 2005, the patient was preferentially referred to the gastrointestinal medicine department for consultation, as he had MES and the possible implication for scalpel management with diathermy for endoscopic polypectomy. Following the supplier's specifications, the digestive medicine department was informed of the impossibility of using shortwave diathermy and microwave diathermy, as this could cause heating of the electrode interface in the tissue, which could cause tissue damage. Therefore, the use of bipolar electrocoagulation was recommended. The digestive service commented that endoscopic polypectomy with bipolar electrocautery could not be performed; furthermore, after consultation with the general surgery service, it was considered that only a total colectomy should be performed after biopsy and anatomopathological diagnosis of the lesions. In view of this clinical situation, it was decided to assess the real effectiveness of the EEM after 7 years of operation and, if ineffective, to remove it in order to be able to perform endoscopic polypectomy using standard diathermy. To this end, the EEM was switched off and the patient was scheduled for assessment after 1 month. At this appointment the patient assessed his baseline pain with a VAS = 4 with episodes of paroxysmal pain of VAS = 7. His degree of disability was similar whether the electrode was on or off. After 6 months of follow-up with the electrode off and no change in the clinical situation, it was decided to remove the EEM and proceed with endoscopic polypectomy. The phantom limb pain worsened over the years with partial response to anticonvulsants and antidepressants. The patient continued to have a baseline VAS of 4 and increasingly frequent episodes of lancinating pain of 10. With regard to his quality of life, the Lattinen index had a value of 12 and, in addition, the patient was depressed and his family life was affected. In view of this situation, it was decided, after reviewing the bibliography, to schedule him for continuous perfusion of ketamine at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg in 60 min, in daily sessions for 1 week. Midazolam 1 mg was administered as premedication. The only adverse effects reported by the patient during the infusions were dizziness and drowsiness. The patient was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months, with a VAS at 6 months of 0 at rest and a decrease in lancinating pain episodes of less than 2 per week, with a VAS in these episodes of 6 and lasting a maximum of 10 s, Lattinen of 5 and a very significant improvement in mood. He was discharged from the unit after one year of follow-up, given the almost complete abolition of the picture without medication.   "
"A 32 year old female patient, referred to the pain unit by the ophthalmology department for pain secondary to herpetic involvement of the ophthalmic branch of the left fifth cranial nerve, with poor response to treatment with tramadol (50 mg/8 h) prescribed by the ophthalmology department. His past history included repeated episodes of keratitis and uveitis in the last 2 years, labelled as herpetic in origin. At the first consultation (2001), the patient reported a picture of left eye pain of about 3 months' duration, with paroxysmal episodes that increased with certain stimuli such as wind, cold or dry eyes. Physical examination revealed no neurological deficits. The pain was rated by the patient with a visual analogue scale (VAS) value of a maximum of 7-8 (during paroxysms) and a minimum of 2. The diagnosis was post-kerkeratotic herpetic neuralgia of the ophthalmic branch of the left fifth cranial nerve. Treatment was started with gabapentin and tramadol in progressive doses, without achieving good pain control and with the appearance of side effects in the form of vomiting and drowsiness. A series of drug rotations were carried out (amitriptyline, topiramate) at different doses which produced no improvement in pain or adverse manifestations. With the patient's consent, treatment was started with low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) (2-4 Hz/s), the intensity used being that accepted by the patient as tolerable. It was applied in fortnightly sessions lasting 30 minutes. The points chosen were: yintai, bilateral taiyang, 18 bilateral ID, 4 bilateral IG, 3 bilateral H, initially combined with gabapentin (300 mg/ 12 h).  After 6 sessions of EA, the patient started to report better analgesic control and better drug tolerance, so gabapentin was increased (900 mg/24 h) and tramadol solution (25 mg every 6-8 h) was added for paroxysmal seizure management only. EA sessions were done on a weekly basis. This was followed by improved analgesic quality, but vomiting persisted. It was decided to discontinue tramadol and to progressively increase gabapentin (2400 mg/24 h) for 2 months. With this new treatment plan, the paroxysmal seizures were gradually controlled in terms of intensity, frequency and duration. After 3 months of clinical stability, the patient reported almost no continuous pain, the paroxysmal crises had decreased in frequency and intensity, and she presented better tolerance to drowsiness. A progressive tapering of gabapentin was started over 3 months until its discontinuation. At the end of this period, the patient reported only paroxysmal seizures of a lower intensity (VAS 4-5) and with inter-crisis intervals of 7-10 days. These were managed with low doses of tramadol solution (25 mg), which was effective for pain control, but was accompanied by nausea, which is why the patient stopped using it. After a period of 6 months with weekly sessions of EA and acceptable control of the condition, a gradual spacing of these sessions was started. Currently, the patient continues treatment in our unit (last consultation January 2009), only with EA sessions every 30-45 days, without any other type of medication, with adequate pain control. Attempts have been made to space out the acupuncture sessions every 60 days, but analgesic control is of poorer quality.   "
"78-year-old woman, referred from the general surgery department to the pain clinic for chronic abdominal pain secondary to intestinal angina. No history of chronic degenerative diseases. She underwent 2 laparotomies in 6 months and 1 diagnostic laparoscopy for episodes of mesenteric ischaemia. - Diagnosis: mesenteric ischaemia corroborated by computed tomography with venous and arterial contrast. - Present illness: patient with chronic, generalised, severe abdominal pain, of 6 months' duration, which does not subside with the usual analgesics. Colicky pain, VAS 10/10, severe EVERA, disabling, episodic, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting, with no factors that increase or decrease it. - Physical examination: weight 45 kg; height 1.50 m; blood pressure 90/50 mmHg; heart rate 65; respiratory rate 18. Conscious, oriented, hydrated, with pallor of mucous membranes and integuments, cachectic. Face, head and neck without alterations, cardiopulmonary without compromise, abdomen with generalised pain in all quadrants, severe, on superficial and deep palpation, peristalsis present and of normal characteristics, without palpable masses. The rest of the physical examination was normal. - Algaeological diagnosis: severe visceral chronic abdominal pain. - Aetiological diagnosis: intestinal angina (mesenteric ischaemia).  Clinical course Therapy with potent opioids (hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, morphine and transdermal fentanyl) and adjuvants, such as calcium antagonists, nitrates, etc., with different rotations and management schemes according to her clinical evolution. Not a candidate for intervention due to clinical status and anticoagulation with acenocoumarin, and due to the use of antiplatelet agents.   "
"We present a clinical case of chronic bladder dysfunction (detrusor hyperactivity), associated with intense refractory pain, secondary to bladder spasms, in a patient requiring continuous bladder lavage. A 58-year-old man was admitted to hospital with macroscopic haematuria, accompanied by suprapubic pain, and had been wearing a urethral catheter for 72 hours prior to admission due to acute urinary retention. His personal history included right lumbosciatica due to lumbar disc protrusions, remote urolithiasis treated with extracorporeal lithotripsy and a long-standing chronic voiding syndrome, in the context of benign prostatic hypertrophy according to prostate biopsy, chronically treated with oral tamsulosin (vo), after two previous transurethral prostate resections. The patient was admitted to the hospital's Urology Department and underwent imaging tests. An abdominopelvic ultrasound scan showed signs of ""wrestling bladder"", with no evidence of obstructive uropathy, and an abdominopelvic CT scan with contrast revealed prostatic hypertrophy and diffuse parietal bladder thickening, compatible with detrusor hypertrophy. The urethral catheter was replaced with a catheter adapted for continuous bladder lavage to dissolve intravesical clots. During the establishment of bladder lavage, episodes of suprapubic colic pain appeared, accompanied by intense neurovegetative cramping and reflux of haematuric bladder fluid, against gravity, from the bladder lavage serum, located about sixty centimetres above the patient's level. After ruling out obstructive problems and urethral catheter positioning, a diagnosis of bladder spasm due to detrusor hyperactivity was made and treatment was started with intravenous (IV) hyoscine butylbromide, metamizole and dexketoprofen, tolterodine and alprazolam, both by IV, and subcutaneous morphine chloride, without success. Given the persistence of the painful symptoms and intolerance to bladder lavage therapy, it was decided to place a lumbar epidural catheter in the L3-L4 intervertebral space, through which a bolus of 80 mg of lidocaine 2% with 50 μg of fentanyl was administered, followed by a perfusion of levobupivacaine 0.125% with fentanyl, at a rate of 5 mg/hour and 4 μg/hour respectively. After the introduction of the epidural block, excellent control was achieved of the painful symptoms and the urodynamic manifestations of bladder spasm, with a level of sensory block at the level of the T12 dermatome and a motor block at grade 0 on the Bromage scale. She was maintained on the aforementioned perfusion until the accidental explantation of the epidural catheter, which occurred seven days later, and iv analgesia was started with morphine chloride at 0.96 mg/hour. On the tenth day of admission, the patient underwent scheduled surgery under intradural anaesthesia for retropubic prostatic adenomectomy, according to Millin's technique, and postoperative analgesia was maintained with iv morphium chloride, associated with iv paracetamol. In addition, tolterodine by mouth was maintained. At 48 h postoperatively, and still under continuous bladder lavage therapy, the episodes of painful bladder spasms reappeared, with similar characteristics to the previous ones, requiring an increase in the morphium chloride infusion rate to 1.8 mg/hour. Placement of a new epidural catheter was ruled out, due to postoperative prophylactic heparinisation. After withdrawal of continuous postoperative bladder lavage due to cessation of haematuria, the clinical picture disappeared completely. The patient reported greater pain relief with epidural block compared to the therapeutic combination of spasmolytics, morphine chloride and tolterodine.   "
"Girl aged 11 years at the time of diagnosis of left ankle sprain treated in Paediatric Traumatology. She was diagnosed with CRPS of the left ankle and foot by Paediatric Rheumatology and started pharmacological treatment; as she did not obtain relief she was referred to the Pain Unit. She was first treated pharmacologically without obtaining adequate pain relief, so it was decided (with prior information and parental consent) to implant, in the operating theatre and under general anaesthesia, a lumbar epidural catheter, initiating, through it, a continuous infusion of local anaesthesia for two weeks. During this time, pain relief was total, but ceased when the local anaesthesia was stopped. For this reason it was decided (with prior information and parental consent) to implant, in the operating theatre and under general anaesthesia, an octopolar electrode in the posterior medullary cords for stimulation of the left leg. The system was programmed once the patient was awake, achieving a very good localisation of the paraesthesias. Two weeks later, the patient was reviewed and continued to respond well to pain and other symptoms, so it was decided to implant an implantable and programmable pulse generator and connect it to the electrode. At present, she continues to be treated with spinal cord stimulation with total remission of the condition.  "
"An 8-year-old girl suffers a left ankle sprain. She is diagnosed with CRPS of the left ankle and foot which resolves completely within a couple of weeks with medical treatment. Two months later, and without any previous trauma, she began to experience pain in her right ankle and foot, which was also diagnosed as CRPS. She was referred to the Pain Unit by the Paediatric Trauma Service two months after this diagnosis. Treatment was started with pregabalin plus tramadol, plus the application of an 8% capsaicin patch due to the severe allodynia she presented, without obtaining adequate relief of either the pain or the rest of the accompanying symptomatology. It was therefore decided (with parental consent) to implant a lumbar epidural catheter in the operating theatre under general anaesthesia and connect it to an external pump to administer a continuous infusion of bupivacaine for two weeks, after which time the infusion was stopped and the catheter removed. Complete remission of symptoms continues.  "
"A 49-year-old female patient (weight: 60 kilos; height: 1.63 metres) consulted the emergency department for 5 days of left lumbar pain, burning and electric type, intensity 10/10 on a verbal analogue scale. The pain is episodic, exacerbated by movement and does not improve with the administration of tramadol and diclofenac. Physical examination revealed erythematous, vesicular lesions with dermatomatous distribution on the skin of the lumbar region and left buttock. The rest of the physical examination was normal. She has a history of lumbar disc disease, arterial hypertension and hypothyroidism under medical treatment. The patient denies any history of renal disease. The patient was assessed by the infectious diseases department, who considered it to be a case of herpetic neuritis and decided to hospitalise the patient due to the severity of the symptoms. During the first day and prior to the hydration protocol (500 ml of 0.9% saline solution), an infusion of intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (600 mg) was started. Consultation with the pain clinic was requested, who started an analgesic programme with acetaminophen + codeine (500 + 30 mg orally every 6 h), morphine in case of severe pain (2 mg per dose) and pregabalin (150 mg/12 h). The patient initially presented adequate analgesia with no side effects, rating her pain at 4/10. On the second day of hospitalisation she presented dizziness, nausea, emesis, somnolence and dysarthria. The symptoms were considered to be a side effect of the analgesics and it was decided to discontinue the acetaminophen with codeine and pregabalin. Morphine doses of 2 mg were prescribed in case of severe pain after assessment of consciousness. On the third day of hospitalisation, without receiving any opioid dose, the patient persisted with deterioration of her general condition, with progression to stupor, tachypnoea, desaturation and respiratory distress. She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. The picture is compatible with acute pulmonary oedema and renal failure with serum potassium at 5.7 mEq/L, BUN 50 mg/dl (admission value of 17.2), creatinine 5.01 mg/dl (admission value of 0.66) and arterial blood gases with metabolic acidosis. Nephrology confirmed the diagnosis of acute renal failure secondary to administration of acyclovir, with the need for haemodialysis. The patient required a single session of haemodialysis with improvement in azo levels. Analgesic management continued with acetaminophen 500 mg and codeine 30 mg; the patient did not require new doses of morphine. She was discharged on the sixth day of hospitalisation with controlled pain and normal renal function tests.   "
"64-year-old male, diabetic and hypertensive. He had severe chronic kidney disease (stage 5 with GFR 11 ml/min/1.73 m2). Scheduled for total right hip arthroplasty due to severe coxarthrosis. He underwent haemodialysis the day before the operation, his ""dry"" weight being 69 kg. At 9:20 a.m. we performed spinal anaesthesia with a 25 G sprotte needle (Pajunk®) with 2.5ml of bupivacaine 0.5% (12.5 mg) obtaining a complete block without incident. At 10:00 a.m. a 25 µg/h fentanyl patch (transdermal therapeutic system -TTS) is applied. The operation was uneventful. On arrival at the post-anaesthesia recovery unit (PRU) (12:30 a.m.) a perfusion of 6 grams of metamizole over 24 hours (in 500 ml of saline at a rate of 21 ml/hour) is started. The patient is admitted to the postoperative acute pain unit (PACU) maintaining the fentanyl patch for 48 hours and rescuing the pain with 200 µg transmucosal oral fentanyl (maximum every 4 hours with a maximum of 4 doses per day). At 16:00 she was discharged to the ward with a score of 2 on the visual analogue scale (VAS). At 22:00, due to a pain peak, a dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl is administered; it subsides after 15 minutes. At 12 hours after removal of the patch (60 hours after the operation) another pain peak appeared, requiring a second oral fentanyl. The VAS on the 2nd and 3rd days was 0. It was on the third day, coinciding with the change from bed to armchair, that the patient reported nausea which subsided with ondansetron 4 mg i.v. During his stay in the care of the ADU he had no vomiting, pruritus or constipation; the quality of sleep and night's rest were good.   "
"A 42-year-old man with a personal history of alcoholism, cocaine abuse and fracture of the right tibial plateau in January 2011 which was treated surgically (osteosynthesis-plate with iliac crest graft). There was an infection of the surgical wound that led to right tibial osteomyelitis after 4 months, requiring several surgical interventions for the removal of osteosynthesis material, debridement and cleaning. The patient has been hospitalised since 4. He has been treated with the latest generation of intravenous antibiotics administered via a central line, and orally with 2 tablets of distraneurine and bromazepam/12 h since admission (to prevent delirium due to alcohol deprivation); as analgesia: pregabalin 75-0-150, paracetamol 1 g/8 h intravenous, metamizole 2 g/8 h intravenous, tramadol 100 mg/8 h intravenous, Enantyun® 25/8 h orally and morphine 5 mg/6 h intravenous (a total of 20 mg intravenous per day). At the 8th month of evolution of the process, the patient was referred to the Pain Unit for poor pain control.  On assessing the patient, he was in a depressed mood and in unbearable pain, with an 8 on the visual analogue scale (VAS 8), of a neuropathic type - intense burning and prickling in the right lower limb (DID) - which made it difficult for him to rest at night and even woke him up. At this time he also had fever peaks of up to 39 oC recorded in the nursing chart, with no organic repercussions. The pain management of this patient was initially straightforward, as he presented mainly with neuropathic pain. We planned to discontinue distraneurine and bromazepam in stages. We switched from intravenous analgesia to oral analgesia, achieving a decrease in symptoms: adding and increasing antineuropathic drugs (1,2): pregabalin (up to 150 mg-0-150 mg) associated with amitriptyline (0-0-25 mg). Discontinuing intravenous morphine and switching to Oxycontin® at equianalgesic doses with morphine (10-0-10 mg) and paracetamol 1 g/8 h, requiring occasional resuscitation with Oxynorm® 5 mg. On the fourth day of follow-up, the patient started with a significant stupor at night and the following day, without responding to stimuli or obeying orders. After ruling out exogenous opioid consumption, the total opioid dose was reduced to MST® 10-0-10 and Adolonta® 100 mg rescue if pain (requiring one before bedtime at the start of treatment and occasionally throughout the day, and no longer required after 10 days). On the fifth day, the patient showed significant psychomotor agitation, incoherent speech and disconnection from the environment, compatible with the diagnosis of withdrawal syndrome. We were forced to make a differential diagnosis. Having ruled out the metabolic origin of the confusional picture (normal blood tests), we thought it was an overdose/abstinence syndrome, for some due to the dose of opioid prescribed and for us due to possible substance abuse (the urine toxicity profile is not conclusive in this regard, The patient was therefore referred to psychiatry to assess the patient and confirm whether there was a pattern of substance abuse (the family denies any drug use by the patient, but they are not always with him) or another origin.  The psychiatrist's diagnostic impression was polymedication, especially opioids, and suggested a short half-life benzodiazepine to control the psychomotor agitation (alprazolam 4 mg v.o./8 h, which was progressively reduced as the symptoms subsided). In this regard, as the opioid had already been tapered, no further action was taken. In terms of pain control, over the next 15 days, the antineuropathic treatment was very effective, except for a persistence of ""shooting"" pain, which required a gradual increase of amitriptyline (1.2) to 75 mg at night. This measure achieved a VAS2, with a significant improvement in night-time rest and mood. In addition, the patient no longer requires rescue, as mentioned above. We could therefore have considered reducing the opioid medication, but the patient continued to present alterations in behaviour and level of consciousness ranging from stupor to psychomotor agitation, with the first repercussion being that the nursing staff did not administer the prescribed opioid, for fear of an opioid overdose leading to respiratory depression, and secondly, he required mechanical restraint after falling and dislocating the spacer placed in the femur. We insisted that all the prescribed medication should be administered and the total dose of opioid (MST® 10-0-10 and Adolonta® 100 mg rescue) was maintained, so as not to relapse into possible withdrawal syndromes. Although the patient presented with febrile peaks, the infectologists following the patient did not consider the fever or any other possible complication arising from the osteomyelitis, such as endocarditis or brain abscess, to be responsible for the condition. As it seemed unlikely that an overdose/abstinence of the prescribed opioids was the origin of the confusional syndrome suffered by this patient for more than 2 weeks, it was decided to rule out organicity by ordering a cranial CT scan after 3 weeks of follow-up. The cranial CT scan showed a subacute right parietal cerebral infarction.   "
"This is a 55-year-old man, allergic to tetracyclines and beta-lactams with a history of arterial hypertension being followed up by the Chronic Pain Unit due to a clinical picture of low back pain and left lumbosciatica of spondyloarthrosis origin with an associated myofascial component. Medical treatment was started with tramadol, pregabalin and duloxetine at the usual doses and diagnostic-therapeutic infiltration with local anaesthetic and corticoids of deep muscles (left psoas and quadratus lumborum). After a clinical improvement of more than 50%, a new infiltration was scheduled, according to hospital protocol, of the psoas and left quadratus lumborum muscles, with botulinum toxin serotype A (Dysport®) 200 IU per muscle in the same session and without incident. Four months later, the patient presented a self-limited episode of eyelid ptosis without consulting for it. Since then, he reported episodes of ptosis, which improved after infiltration with local anaesthetic and corticosteroids of trigger points in the shoulder girdle. Six months later, he presented with an episode of palpebral ptosis associated with diplopia and mandibular weakness, for which he consulted the Neurology Department of the hospital and was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG), starting treatment with corticosteroids and pyridostigmine with improvement of the clinical picture.   "
"A 70-year-old man with pudendal nerve neuralgia secondary to a direct lesion following trans-ureteral resection of the prostate (TUR-P). He reported pain with neuropathic characteristics (burning, paraesthesia) in the external genitalia. Of severe intensity (VAS 10/10), associated with pain on defecation and urination, which was relieved after the procedure. As a first measure in the unit, after 5 years of pain, pharmacological therapy was started with carbamazepine (200 mg/d), pregabalin (150 mg/12 hours), amitriptyline (25 mg/every night) and tramadol (200 mg/12 hours). Due to lack of response to pharmacological treatment, following the protocol of the previous cases, depression and mild anxiety were reported in the Beck depression questionnaire and the Goldberg health questionnaire, which did not contraindicate the placement of the device, so CENPP was performed in September 2014. Symptomatological improvement was obtained, so NERSR implantation was performed. He presented a complication due to CSF fistula, which resolved at the sixth week with conservative management. One month after treatment, the patient was pain-free. Currently, the patient has 100% coverage without oral medications. Beck Depression Questionnaire and Goldberg Health Questionnaire with mild anxiety with no depressive data.   "
"The present case is that of a 62-year-old man suffering from central thoracic pain, tingling sensation in the hands and nausea. A week earlier he had had a similar episode without requiring medical assistance. Forty-five minutes after the onset of symptoms, he was attended at the local hospital, diagnosed as having an inferior infarction, and started fibrinolysis with Streptokinase 1,500,000 IU. He was also treated with Solinitrin, Aspirin and Zantac, and was subsequently referred to the Regional Hospital as there were no beds available in the Coronary Unit. Half an hour after admission to the Hospital Comarcal (around 4.30 hours after the onset of symptoms), he began to experience pain in both lower limbs, accompanied by intense pallor and no pulse. Computerised Axial Tomography (CAT) was performed, which ruled out aortic dissection and, suspecting embolism, he was referred to the Provincial Hospital. At the referral centre, a CT scan of the chest showed no pathology in the thoracic aorta and an ultrasound scan of the lower limbs showed bilateral occlusion at the popliteal level. He underwent surgery and bilateral embolectomy, recovering the colour, but the coldness persisted. The histopathological study showed fibrohaematic thrombotic material. After the first few hours the patient showed haemodynamic instability, with the appearance of lividity in the lower limbs, renal failure and shock, with death finally occurring 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. The external examination of the corpse revealed a purplish-red colouring in the lower third of the thighs, knees, genital area and lower abdomen. The lungs were increased in size and consistency, crepitus was perceived on pressure, the fingerprint remained after pressure (fovea) and when cut, after compression, foam spurted out. The right lung weighed 850 grams and the left lung weighed 640 grams. After incising the pericardial sac, a slight cardiomegaly weighing 390 grams was observed. The left ventricle was hypertrophic with a maximum free wall thickness of 2 cm. Histopathological analysis of the heart showed chronic ischaemic heart disease, with an old infarct and a recent infarct, 1-3 weeks old, on the posterior aspect of the left ventricle. The thoracic aorta has a large ruptured atherosclerotic plaque with intraplaque haemorrhage and thrombotic material adhering below the arch. The endothelium of the abdominal aorta is occupied by reddish coagulated haematic material. The liver exhibited a steatotic appearance. Examination of the liver and lung confirms the macroscopic diagnoses of steatosis and pulmonary oedema.  In the arterioles supplying the skeletal muscles of the legs, there were numerous emboli from ruptured atheroma plaques causing ischaemic necrosis of the muscle fibres.  Histologically, the kidneys show acute tubular necrosis, myoglobin pigment in tubules and emboli in arterioles from ruptured atheroma plaques.   "
"A 5-year-old boy with an unremarkable personal history and adequate paediatric control. The parents only emphasised that he was a child who did not eat much. A week before the incident, he presented with an upper respiratory tract cold without fever or other associated signs. The parents report that he also presented non-specific abdominal discomfort, accompanied by increased bowel sounds and nausea without vomiting. He was assessed by his local paediatrician, who found no specific pathology and prescribed a soft diet. At 0 hours on the day of death, the child woke up with unfocused abdominal pain. Over the next few hours, he felt nauseous and had several episodes of vomiting, first of food and finally mucous vomiting with no hematic or bilious traces. At 5 a.m., he was found to be weak and cold and was given a hot bath, and in the bath he was found to be unresponsive to stimuli. The assistance of an emergency team was requested, who found him in cardiorespiratory arrest and started CPR manoeuvres without success. A legal autopsy was performed. He was a normal male child, 1.17 m tall, with no signs of obesity or malnutrition, with pale skin and mucous membranes. A complete autopsy was performed with opening of the three cavities and the anterior cervical plane, following the recommendations of the Council of Europe [1]. No significant pathological alterations or developmental anomalies were observed. During the autopsy, the examination of the abdominal cavity revealed a collection of serohaematic fluid of approximately 0.5 litres. The stomach shows little food debris with no haematic traces, coffee grounds or bilious debris. The walls of the duodenum are preserved and the intestinal contents are normal. About 20 cms from the duodeno-jejunal angle, the colour of the intestinal walls turns dark red, maintaining this colour change until about 5 cms from the ileo-caecal valve. This last segment of the ileum is clearly narrowed with fibrous changes. Inside the segment of small intestine with parietal changes, there is a haematic content of approximately 1.5 litres.  The position of the intestinal loops is altered by the presence of an anomaly in the closure of the mesentery of the cecum. There is an eyelet of about 3 cm in diameter located immediately next to the cecum, through which the extensive passage of the small intestinal loops and part of the descending colon can be seen, which is dilated and lateralised to the right and interrupted in its course by the passage through the eyelet, continuing towards the rectum from the said eyelet.  The cause of death is estimated to be haemorrhagic shock secondary to mechanical obstruction and necrosis of the small intestine due to transmesocolic hernia with internal herniation of the small and large intestine.

"A 19-year-old male in military uniform was found in the dorsal decubitus position with both upper limbs on the sides of the body, in an open night scene. A weapon of military manufacture and use was identified on the left forearm: the Light Automatic Rifle - FAL, model PARA Nº 50-63, super-compact with folding stock and flame-retardant muzzle, calibre 7.62 x 51 mm NATO, velocity 810 m/s. The stock was found resting on the left hand (which was in a firing spasm) with the rifle in a position parallel to the body with the muzzle about 30 cm from the head, magazine and firing pin facing outwards. The scene and the victim's clothes were found without signs of violence. The deceased presented blunt injuries of a tearing type in his oral cavity, abundant epistaxis, otorrhagia and a large blood stain under his head.  Once the protocols for fixing the scene of the crime had been carried out, the body was turned to corroborate the existence of a presumed exit wound in relation to the large blood stain under the head, and a small circular wound with regular edges was identified at the cervical level. The presence of a cavity in the ground was found to correspond perfectly with the cranial cavity and a perforation in the ground in direct connection with the presumed exit wound. The probing of this perforation allowed us to establish its depth at about 20 cm with an angulation of the trajectory coinciding with that estimated between the buccal cavity and the cervical orifice, in a right-left, bottom-up direction. The excavation of this perforation favoured the recovery of the projectile, embedded in its depth.  During the autopsy procedure in the morgue and given the lesions of maxillofacial and maxillofacial involvement, the lesions were described as follows: 1. Large contused lesion in the oral cavity with periorificial tearing on both margins and stellate shape, with accentuated destruction towards the right side of the individual. Deposit of greyish-blackish pigments throughout the oral mucosal lining, more marked in the left jugal mucosa. A large tear was identified throughout the lingual body with identical presence of pigment. In the most posterior and left lateral sector at the level of the junction of the hard and soft palate and the isthmus of the fauces, a circular perforation of 1.5 cm in diameter and intense haemorrhage were observed. In terms of hard structures, maxillary and mandibular fractures were observed at the junction of the respective central and lateral incisors, with displacement and significant mobility of fracture ends towards the right side. No direct or indirect dentoperiodontal lesions were found in maxillary teeth. Regarding the mandibular teeth, the lower right central incisor was intact but avulsed and displaced towards the mandibular basal at the depth of the fracture line, while the lateral incisor on the same side showed a longitudinal amelo-cemento-dentine fracture with loss of substance. The missing tooth fragment was identified at the depth of the mandibular fracture line, on the same side as the avulsed central incisor.  2. Circular perforating lesion with regular borders, 1.5 cm in diameter, located in the midline slightly to the left at the posterior cervical level about 3 cm below the occipital eminence, partially hidden by the hair. Macroscopic examination verified the absence of metallic particles.  3. Passive probing of the trajectory established communication between the perforation described in the depth of the oral cavity, in the left posterior sector, with the orifice at cervical level, establishing a rectilinear direction slightly right-left, front-back, down-up, involving the musculature of the pharynx, the soft palate and the tongue. On examination, no metallic debris was identified along this path. Given the atypical morphology of both orifices, a tongue wedge was obtained, fixed in 10% formalin and processed with the routine technique of paraffin embedding and haematoxylin-eosin staining at the Laboratorio de Pericias en Odontología Forense, Córdoba (Argentina). The identification of powder deflagration particles embedded between the lingual striated muscle bundles and the absence of these particles in the exit wound confirmed the oral cavity as the point of entry of the projectile.  Toxicological tests were negative for both alcohol and drugs. The absence of signs of a struggle (both at the scene and on the subject's clothing), the location and number of wounds, the direction and distance of the shot and the spasm in the left hand, compatible with the position of the weapon (reconstruction of the event was performed), all elements listed in the literature as characteristic of suicide [7, 8, 11], and the collection of personal information that revealed a recent history potentially indicative of self-harm, determined the medico-legal aetiology of suicide.

"This is a 53-year-old woman with a history of migraines. She presented with sciatica refractory to treatment and a herniated disc L5-S1. After informed consent and preoperative study without contraindications, L5-S1 microdiscectomy was performed. The operative technique, including preparation and positioning, was as follows: - Anaesthesia General anaesthesia was performed, with orotracheal intubation. Induction was performed with Propofol, analgesia with Renifentanil (m opioid receptor agonist, with analgesic potency similar to fentanyl), and relaxation with Atracurium Besylate (competitive or non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent). Sevofluorane was used as a volatile anaesthetic. During the procedure, 100 mg Tramadol (centrally acting analgesic, pure non-selective µ, delta and kappa opioid receptor agonist) and 25 mg Dexketoprofen tromethamol were administered. The duration of anaesthesia was 1 hour 50 minutes without any complications of any kind during the anaesthesia. - Placement The patient was placed in the Mohammedan position, with the pectoral region and iliac crests supported on special pillows, with central recesses to avoid decubitus of the abdomen and breasts.  The head was supported on a cushioned system in the form of a cranially open donut. To avoid ocular support, the eyes were protected with lubricant and eye pads held in place by a bandage placed circularly over the head at the level of both eyes. The lower extremities were padded in the decubitus regions (both knees). Pedial and posterior tibial pulses were checked on both sides. The position of the patient's back was parallel to the ground. - Surgical technique It was performed by conventional microsurgery with a two-finger midline incision, section of the common sacro-lumbar aponeurosis, retraction of the paravertebral musculature, flavectomy, root dissection and excision of the extracted disc herniation. Blood loss was minimal and no blood was administered. A small amount of hydrogen peroxide was used as a haemostatic (about 5 cc). - Immediate postoperative period Upon awakening from anaesthesia, the patient reported that she could not see anything at all in either eye. Ophthalmology was requested and no pathology was found. Ocular tension was normal. The photomotor and consensual reflexes were preserved. An emergency brain CT scan was performed, which showed an image in the right intraventricular choroidal circulation compatible with a gas bubble. Another right occipital occipital juxta-osseous image was considered doubtful.  A cranial MRI was performed, which showed a diffuse signal increase in T2 sequences in posterior areas of both occipital lobes. The MRI angiography was normal.  The picture was interpreted as being of vascular origin, either positional or derived from the patient's migraine history, and she was empirically treated with dexamethasone and vasodilators. After 6 hours, she reported perceiving indistinguishable and faint chromatic shapes, with the appearance of a threat reflex. The following morning (12 hours after the operation), he reported having recovered his vision, although he perceived chromatic halos around the figures presented to him. These dyschromatopsias disappeared within 24 hours. A follow-up MRI showed significant improvement of the occipital images seen on the previous MRI.  Subsequent controls (one month after surgery) showed visual normality.   "
"18-year-old woman with a history of syncope one month before the fatal event, having not consulted a doctor. She was sitting with her family on the bank of a river when she suddenly felt unwell, lost consciousness and fell into the water. She was immediately recovered from the water but died a few minutes later. Initially it was suspected that it could have been an accidental submersion. The autopsy was performed with a postmortem delay of 16 hours. The corpse was an athletic female of a height of 1.65 m and weight of approximately 54.5 kg (BMI 20 kg/m2), with no external signs of violence or marfanoid habitus. On opening the thoracic cavity, a massive left haemothorax of 3,000 cc was found due to rupture of a saccular aneurysm of the terminal portion of the aortic arch, slightly distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The aneurysm measured 4.2 x 4.6 cm and its markedly thinned wall was barely 1 mm thick. The rupture line measured 2 mm in length and was located in the infero-anterior region of the aneurysmal sac.  The heart weighed 200 g, the expected weight being 199 g according to Kitzman's tables. At the level of the subaortic endocardium there was a clear, slightly thickened area. Both the atrioventricular and semilunar valves were normal, as was the origin of the coronary arteries. Histopathological examination of the aneurysm wall showed thinning of the aortic wall at the expense of rupture and loss of elastic fibres and reduction of muscle tissue which was replaced by a non-fibrillar basophilic matrix.  Given the suspicion of the existence of an atypical collagenopathy, i.e. without phenotypic expression, genetic screening for Marfan Syndrome was performed on the younger sister of the deceased - after genetic counselling at the Children's Hospital. The technique used was molecular genetic research of the FBN1 marker, which was amplified by standard PCR protocol, sequenced and quantified by electropherograms (capillary electrophoresis), analysed and compared with reference sequences. The study was negative. Other diseases were not screened due to the lack of genetic markers at that time.   "
"A child was admitted to hospital in cardiorespiratory arrest, apparently due to a gunshot wound to the oropharynx, according to the relatives, without a first inspection showing any injuries of this nature. The court was informed and a forensic autopsy was carried out. Beforehand, a radiological study of the cranial extremity and the cervical spine was carried out, showing the existence of a foreign body of metallic density lodged in the spinal canal at the level of C2, compatible with a firearm projectile, as well as a smaller fragment in C3-C4.  Post-mortem examination Male subject, 11 years old, totally naked, with a bloodied face. He presented as signs of medical action stitches in both wrists and left forearm and adhesive discs for electrocardiographic recording.  After cleaning the blood from his face, a small crescent-shaped excoriation with a discrete loss of substance was observed on the supero-internal ridge of the right nostril.  The first step was an autopsy of the spine, separating the skin coverings and muscle masses, with no haemorrhagic areas visible. After sectioning the transverse processes and the skull, the spinal cord is removed together with the brain, and a deformed firearm projectile is found in the vertebral canal at the level of the 2nd dorsal vertebra, which has partially severed the spinal cord, 35 mm from the bulb.  The cervical block was then removed, revealing an excoriation at the base of the tongue, a large retropharyngeal haematoma and the intraosseous trajectory of the projectile. The rest of the structures and organs examined were uncharacteristic. After the operations performed, it was concluded that death was caused by a single gunshot wound penetrating through a natural orifice, specifically the right nostril, producing at this level a small crescent-shaped wound with slight loss of substance. It follows a front-to-back and slightly up-and-down path, pierces the hard palate, grazes the surface of the tongue, crosses the retropharyngeal space and, after passing through the intervertebral disc, lodges in the anterior wall of the spinal canal, injuring the spinal cord.  The morphological characteristics indicated a long-distance shot, possibly of a medico-legal aetiology of an accidental nature, which was confirmed during the police investigation.   "
"27-year-old man shot in the skull during a police chase. He was taken to a medical centre and died after 24 hours as a result of the encephalic injury. Among the autopsy findings were two holes in the scalp (right frontal and parietal) and a single bony entry wound in the right parietal bone with no bony exit wound. The cutaneous entry wound, without tattooing or smoking, is classified as ""far"" or ""long distance"". The scalp was removed and a bone entry wound was observed in the right parietal region, elongated, with external bevelling limited to the most posterior area of the wound, with a fracture trace. A fragment of the projectile was recovered in the right occipital region, deformed, made of bare lead, .38 calibre, with a sector of its surface ""mirrored"". The rest of the projectile produces a cutaneous exit wound in the right parietal region, almost superimposed on the bony entry wound. Histological examination confirms the nature of the cutaneous orifices.   "
"A 33-year-old man, with no known pathological history, was admitted to a hospital emergency department at 7.43 am, from his home, with the diagnosis of ""cranial traumatism causing ischaemic stroke"". The previous evening he had been hit in the neck by a ball while playing a football match as a goalkeeper. During his admission, a cranial CAT scan was performed, which revealed an ischaemic infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery as a consequence of a traumatic dissection of the right internal carotid artery. He presented endocranial hypertension and cerebral herniation with evolution towards encephalic death, for which he entered the organ donation programme and died 10 days after his admission.  "
"The forensic pathology department received the case of a 66-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension, fibromyalgia and myasthenia gravis diagnosed 20 years previously. She was under chronic antihypertensive treatment with amlodipine (10 mg/24 h), furosemide (40 mg/24 h) and losartan postassium (50 mg/24 h), anxiolytic - antidepressant with duloxetine (30 mg/24 h) and amytriptyline hidorchloride (10 mg/24 h), treatment for osteoporosis with calcifediol (800 mg/24 h) and gastric protection with omeprazole (20 mg/24 h). One week before death, she consulted the emergency department for catarrhal symptoms that were treated with ciprofloxacin and carbocisteine, with improvement of the respiratory symptoms. Two days before his death, he consulted the emergency department again because of general weakness, which was attributed to the antibiotic treatment and the discontinuation of the treatment was indicated. There were no symptoms of headache and/or other symptoms of neurological focality in her clinical history. The patient died suddenly and her husband reported dyspnoea as the only symptom prior to death. During the autopsy the most remarkable findings were the following: Height of 149 cm, weight of 80 kg and Body Mass Index of 36 kg/m2, which corresponded to type II obesity. Other notable findings on external examination were hirsutism, mid-thoracotomy scar as a consequence of thymectomy for the treatment of myasthenia gravis and oedema of the lower extremities. As external signs of violent cause, a recent right buttock haematoma was found, compatible with the fall she suffered during the perimortal period and with the sitting position on the floor in which she was found during the body removal. The most relevant findings of the internal examination were a coagulated haemopericardium of 200 g, the heart weighed 400 g (expected weight 320 g) and we observed a 0.5 cm tear in the middle anterior part of the left ventricle due to transmural infarction secondary to coronary atheromatosis of the three vessels, more marked in the middle third of the anterior descending artery where it obstructed the vascular lumen by more than 75%. In the skull, the presence of internal frontal hyperostosis was notable, less marked in the parietal area. The thickness of the unaffected diploe was 8 mm, while in the areas of hyperostosis the thickness ranged from 1.5 mm to 2.3 mm. In addition, multiple calcified meningiomas were found following the superior longitudinal sinus, most of them nodular in shape and some of them smaller, spiculated and plaque-like. At the cerebral level, a slight depression of the surface of both frontal lobes was observed.  The rest of the autopsy findings were not significant and the results of the toxicological analysis were negative. The histopathological study was concordant with the macroscopic data of internal frontal hyperostosis and the meningiomas were calcified psammomatous.   "
"17-year-old male with a history of paraplegia secondary to a gunshot wound to the T1 vertebra. He died at home without medical assistance and a judicial autopsy was ordered. a) External examination: atrophy of the four extremities and ankylosis of the hands, decubitus ulcers with necrotic tissue at bitrocantéreo and sacrum level. Tracheostomy cannula at cervical level. He was carrying a urinary catheter connected to a collection bag containing urine with a striking purple colour.  b) Internal examination: brain with significant weight gain (1,875 g) with cerebral oedema pattern (flattening of gyri and convolutions). Heart of normal weight (325 g) with discrete dilatation of right cardiac cavities and presence of mural thrombi. Right pleural and interlobular adhesions and pulmonary thromboembolism in the left branch of the pulmonary artery. Lungs were slightly overweight (D: 640 g; I: 600 g) with moderate to severe congestion and oedema. There was no evidence of pulmonary infarction. Normal kidney weight (D: 180 g; I: 130 g) with poor cortico-medullary differentiation, haemorrhage in the medullary area and areas of purplish discolouration with purulent material exiting through the renal pelvis. The urinary bladder showed 400 cc of cloudy urine, foul odour associated with greenish-cream coloured sediment at the bottom with a purulent appearance.  c) Complementary examinations: - Toxicological analysis negative in blood, urine and vitreous humour samples. - Microbiological analysis. Urinary sediment culture showed growth of Proteus vulgaris. d) Cause of death: Pulmonary thromboembolism was considered the immediate cause of death, urinary tract infection as an intermediate cause and paraplegia as the underlying cause.

"A 19-year-old male died suddenly while doing weight training exercises in a gymnasium. Death was witnessed by several witnesses who saw him become unconscious and faint. Basic and advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were performed for 55 minutes. The patient's medical history included valvular heart disease, without specifying the type or degree of involvement, and several relatives who had died of cardiac pathology. The family was uncooperative in providing information. The external examination performed during the autopsy showed signs of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Normal build, weight 84 kg, height 176,5 cm, body mass index 27,12. Internal examination revealed cardiomegaly (heart weight 555 g), concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle (free wall of the left ventricle and interventricular septum of 2.1 cm each) and pulmonary oedema (right lung 665 g and left lung 550 g). The macroscopic cardiac examination revealed a thickening of the aortic valve leaflets, which significantly reduced the permeable area, which measured with the measuring cone was 0.5 cm2. After opening the valve annulus, the circumference measured 7 cm, and a bicuspid aortic valve with a medial raphe in one of the leaflets next to the left ostium was visualised. The cause of death was established as aortic stenosis.   "
"A 51-year-old woman, with a history of unilateral adnexectomy for endometriosis, who after 24 hours of evolution presented with fever of up to 40oC and odynophagia, which partially subsided with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Subsequently, vomiting and several diarrhoeal stools appeared, with persistence of the febrile syndrome, so she went to the health centre. After medical assessment, antipyretic treatment and home observation were prescribed. Hours later, his general condition worsened, with hypotension, and he also reported headache and dorsalgia, so the Emergency Department was notified and he was transferred to hospital. Physical examination revealed a fair general state, tachypnoea at rest and tachycardia, and blood pressure could not be detected, nor was it possible to palpate the peripheral radial pulses. There was no nuchal rigidity or neurological focality. Laboratory tests and blood gas analysis revealed marked leukocytopenia (2,440/ml) and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.21; HCO3 14 mmol/l; EB -11.1 mmol/l). The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where, despite treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous antibiotic therapy, she worsened and died 2 hours later, after cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres. Due to the torpid evolution and the uncertain origin of the shock, death was not certified. Autopsy findings Significant findings on external examination included a generalised skin rash, more pronounced on the head and on the anterior face of the upper third of the thorax, and petechiae on the tarsal conjunctivae of both lower eyelids.  In the internal examination, macroscopically it is observed: - Moderate pulmonary congestion with significant pulmonary oedema of alveolar and interstitial characteristics with bronchial foam. - Right pleural effusion. Mild pericardial effusion. - Exudative fluid in retromammary subcutaneous tissue on both sides, purulent appearance. - Liver with steatotic appearance with haemorrhagic stippling. - Both adrenal glands with congestive-hemorrhagic marrow.  - The brain had a generalised congestive and oedematous appearance, with a casual finding of a cyst in the left parietal lobe.  Samples of the brain, lung, liver, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, heart, peripheral blood, vitreous humour, pericardial fluid, intestinal contents, bronchial smear, pleural effusion and swab impregnated with subcutaneous exudate from the right pectoral muscle were submitted for toxicological, microbiological and histopathological studies. The results of the microbiological study carried out using antigenic techniques, culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the presence of N. meningitidis serogroup C in peripheral blood, serum and, in small quantities, at the encephalic level. Epidemiological characterisation of the strain and the study of antibiotic resistance by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were carried out. Histopathological findings in the brain included congestion and oedema, as well as the existence of a transitional-psammomatous meningioma. Both adrenals showed severe haemorrhage; the liver showed signs suggestive of shock in the initial phase, and at the renal level there were alterations compatible with DIC. In addition, splenomegaly and some neutrophilic myocarditis were diagnosed. The toxicology study showed only positive results for dipyrone or metamizole. Based on the findings described above, the causes of death were established as multi-organ failure due to fulminant meningococcal septicaemia (N. meningitidis serogroup C) and Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.   "
"The patient was a 30-year-old heterosexual male with a personal history of poor school performance and an overprotective upbringing pattern. He had been in a stable relationship for several years and had a daughter. At the time of the examination, he was awaiting trial for two sexual assaults, one week apart, both of which involved the use of an intimidating instrument (knife) and the second victim had sustained injuries as a result of her resistance (dislocated shoulder). He had no previous criminal record. Accused acts In relation to these, he recounts the introduction into his car, under intimidation with a knife, of a stranger ""whom he liked"", whom he groped and kissed after convincing her not to go any further for the sake of his daughter; he left her at the door of his house, with threats of being able to locate her if she told him what had happened. After about a week, he repeated the same sequence, although this time the victim tried to run away from the car, causing injuries to herself when she was held down by the victim. Both sexual assaults coincided with a period of deterioration in the couple's relationship, and in the second one there was a clear precedent of frustration related to the non-fulfilment of the expectations of having a sexual relationship with a stranger with whom he had a telephone relationship, and towards whom the victim had feelings of incipient infatuation. Relevant findings in the psychosexual sphere He highlighted the existence of a low level of sexual arousal, as well as a high frequency in the practice of different sexual activities (coitus and masturbation). The expert witness presented various deviant sexual behaviours, which began with practices with little interaction with the victims (voyeurism with masturbation), gradually leading to an increase in interaction, both verbal (obscene compliments) and physical (touching without the possibility of a response from the victims), until the events with which he was charged. Habitual user of pornography and occasional prostitution. Psychopathological findings No significant alterations were found in axis I. Given that while he was in prison and prior to the forensic medical examination he was diagnosed with mild mental retardation by the psychologist of a non-governmental organisation, he was referred to the forensic psychologist to support the diagnostic presumption of borderline intelligence with psychometric tests, which were not valid with regard to the calculation of the intelligence quotient (IQ) due to the poor collaboration of the expert witness (he presented metasimulative behaviour according to the forensic psychological report), reaching the diagnostic conclusion of borderline intelligence on the basis of his adaptive abilities, after clinical examination and application of the Intensity of Support Scale. With regard to Axis II, the inmate showed typical features of the borderline personality disorder construct: verbalised cognitions related to fear of abandonment by his partner, having developed crude strategies to avoid such abandonment, such as prohibiting his partner from using the car to avoid abandonment, or restricting access to family accounts; he showed feelings of low self-esteem, identifying its origin in the rejection of his partner on a sexual level, but also in the perception of actions on her part aimed at his undervaluation before other people; at the same time, he showed an unstable self-image, oscillating between feelings of high self-worth and feelings of inferiority; poor social environment, with interpersonal relationships alternating between idealisation and devaluation. High impulsivity manifested in different areas of his private life, as well as significant mood reactivity. In addition, the inmate verbalised cognitive distortions aimed at minimising the use of violence against his partner and the victims, even blaming his partner for the alleged acts due to her sexual rejection, and the second victim for her injuries because she resisted the sexual activity by trying to flee; manifested other cognitive distortions about women and their role in society (female role related only to the care of the home and children, without active participation in the decisions derived from living together as a couple), as well as about sexuality (justification of sexual activity with her partner with the mediation of violence in the absence of the latter's persistent refusal to have sexual relations). Functional analysis of reported sexual behaviours, as well as sexual aggressions, showed a consistent association between the practice of sexual behaviours and feelings of sexual frustration and associated cognitions (feelings of low self-worth and thoughts related to abandonment).  "
"A 25-year-old Colombian woman was admitted to our obstetrics department for presenting with rupture of membranes at 24 weeks and 5 days gestation. She had no family or personal history of interest. Gynaecological history: menarche at 14 years of age; M.F.: 3-4/32. In a routine pregnancy examination performed at 20 weeks' gestation, she was diagnosed with vaginal condylomatosis. Examination on admission: patient was apyretic. Inspection of the external genitalia revealed multiple vulvoperineal condylomas. TV: cervix formed, posterior and closed. There was abundant clear water flowing. Ultrasound: foetus in cephalic longitudinal. Posterior placenta, ILA 8 (amniotic fluid index). F.C.F. positive. Estimated foetal weight: 641 g.  Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was started and a series of complementary tests were performed (complete CBC, serology, vaginal, rectal and amniotic fluid cultures, and hybridisation test for HPV), the results of which are shown in table 1, and which led to the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis.  Labour was triggered one week later and due to the presence of chorioamnionitis and foetal immaturity was allowed to progress. Delivery was spontaneous, with a live male foetus of 690 g, pH of artery 7.24 and pH of vein 7.48. Apgar test at 1 and 5.5. Placenta of 167 g, hypermature with signs of chorioamnionitis. After delivery, biopsies of the vagina and perineum were performed, the results of which were: condyloma acuminatum of the vagina and condyloma acuminatum of the perineum respecting the edges. The neonate died at 40 days of life.  "
"A 73-year-old woman attended the emergency department after an accidental fall due to tripping on the stairs at home. The left limb presented with the knee in fixed flexion of 40º and external rotation of the hip. The femoral condyles were clearly palpable, with a 'pseudo-hip impingement' proximal to the patella. The attitude in flexion was not changed by pain when attempting to change the position. The patella was fixed and tight. Any attempt at flexion-extension resulted in severe pain and tightness of the quadricipital tendon and goose foot. The radiological study showed a low patella with its proximal pole in contact with the intercondylar area, compatible with lower horizontal dislocation of the patella.  Reduction by manipulation was unsuccessful, so epidural anaesthesia was performed, producing a sonorous audible 'clunk' or patellar snap when performing patellar traction and knee extension, after which the patella was anatomically arranged. The patellar and quadricipital tendons were found to be undamaged and functional, without haematoma, with correct gliding and tension. The anterior tibial tuberosity was also found to be in normal condition. The joint was stable in both varus and valgus in extension and 30° semi-flexion, with no haemorrhagic focus in LLE, LLI or goose foot. External arthrotomy was performed with extraction of 30 cc of sero-haematic synovial fluid, where the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were found to be normal. There was evident femoro-patellar arthrosis with chondyle and patellar osteophytosis (Ahlbach grade III). We performed excision of the patellar osteophytes and the intercondylar groove. The patient was immobilised with a knee orthosis in extension for 2 weeks with support, after which physiotherapy was started for 2 weeks. One month after the trauma he presented flexion of -30º and full extension, with absence of pain. Two months after the accident she presented full flexion-extension. The radiological study at that time showed knee with predominantly femoro-patellar arthrosis (Ahlbach grade III).  A characteristic of the patient that helps to explain the injury is that the patient had generalised hyperelasticity. Four years later, she has suffered no recurrence and only reports discomfort in the anterior area of both knees when descending stairs, compatible with her femoro-patellar osteoarthritis. This symptomatology was already present before the dislocation.   "
"A 46-year-old male smoker with chronic alcoholism of approximately 20 years' duration, with subsequent alcoholic hepatitis diagnosed eight years ago. The patient has no other history of interest. Our patient consulted for the presence of masses in the anterior and posterior cervical region, in retroauricular areas and in the anterior-superior region of the thorax, which had been present for more than ten years. These lumps did not cause pain, dyspnoea or dysphagia. Examination revealed diffuse swelling in the anterior cervical region, which blurred the mandibular line, together with tumours in retroauricular areas and in the left deltoid region, plus two lumps in the posterior region of the neck, each measuring about 5 cm in diameter, rising up to the occipital area. They are not painful on palpation and are hard in consistency.  Cardiopulmonary auscultation, abdominal palpation and neurological examination were normal. Laboratory tests showed the following values: aspartate transferase 131 U/l; alanine transferase 71 U/l; GGT 880 U/l; total cholesterol 228 mg/dl; LDL 105.2 mg/dl; triglycerides 304 mg/dl. Thyroid hormones and cortisol were normal. Imaging tests were initially started with a chest X-ray without pathological changes. Subsequently the patient underwent a thyroid ultrasound with the result of normal thyroid lobes and a large bilateral subcutaneous lipomatous mass. The cervical CT scan showed a marked accumulation of fatty tissue located mainly subcutaneously in the occipital region and, more caudally, subcutaneously and in deep planes reaching the carotid space. The distribution of the fatty tissue was diffuse, symmetrical, and no encapsulations were identified. The fatty tissue contained both anterior jugular veins. Biopsy confirmed the presence of adipose tissue and ruled out tumour infiltration. The patient underwent an anterior cervical lipectomy, preserving the sternocleidomastoid, jugular veins and main nerve structures, achieving a significant improvement in aesthetic appearance. The patient was referred to a mental health service in order to support alcohol cessation.   "
"The patient is a 50-year-old woman who is an occasional smoker. Her personal history of interest included a nine-day tourist trip to the Mayan Riviera (Mexican Caribbean), fifteen days before the onset of symptoms. During the trip, the patient reported numerous mosquito bites. In the 48 hours prior to consultation, the patient self-treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as an antipyretic and symptomatic treatment for headache. On physical examination the patient was conscious, oriented and febrile (37.6ºC), BP=110/70. There was facial flushing and bilateral conjunctival injection as well as the presence of a haemorrhagic, symmetrical, maculo-papular rash on the trunk and extremities, especially on the lower limbs, where it was confluent, and which did not change on vitropressure. In the rest of the examination by apparatus, only the presence of numerous latero- and retrocervical adenopathies and preauricular adenopathies was identified. There was no evidence of meningismus or hepatosplenomegaly.  The Rumpell-Leade loop test showed more than 30 petechiae in the right antecubital fossa. A haematological examination showed: red blood cells 4.90x106/microL with haematocrit of 43% and normal platelets. The white blood count showed 7,700 leukocytes with relative lymphopenia (22%) and the presence of numerous activated lymphocytes. The ESR was 28 mm at 1 hour, with CRP=6.62 mg/dL. Coagulation tests were normal for both tracts. Biochemistry showed a creatinine of 1.28 mg/dL with ALT=78 U/L transaminitis. Gross gout and blood smear were negative. Finally, the immunological analysis determined: negative MgIgAc against CMV, negative HBcAc, HBsAgAg and HBsAgAg, negative MgIgAc against P. falciparum and positive MgIgAc against dengue (IFA). Blood smear and blood smear did not detect the presence of blood parasites. The patient was diagnosed with classical dengue with probable criteria for ASA-induced dengue haemorrhagic fever grade 1. After withdrawal, the patient recovered completely within 10 days.   "
"A 78-year-old patient with a history of arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and repeated nephritic colic who 6 days before admission began with pain in the right renal fossa with irradiation to the ipsilateral knee, which was treated as an outpatient with dexametaxone, lidocaine, cyanocobalamin and thiamine without resolution. Subsequently, the patient began to feel dystrophic with thermometric temperature above 38ºC, poor general condition, urinary symptoms and glycaemic decompensation, for which he was admitted to hospital. Physical examination revealed marked general malaise, fever, pain in the sacral area with negative bilateral percussion fist and knees with signs of phlogosis. Laboratory tests showed mild leukocytosis without left shift (12,100x103/mm3 with N 65%), hyperbilirubinaemia with direct predominance (BT: 3.4 mg/dl, BD: 2.7mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase 215 U/L (35-104). The rest of the laboratory tests showed no significant alterations. Complementary examinations included blood and urine cultures, joint fluid puncture and cultures, CT scan of the abdominal and lumbosacral spine, magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine and scintigraphy with Ga-67/MDP-Tc-99. The CT scan of the abdominal and lumbosacral spine shows air densities in the lumbar and right psoas muscles and in the intraspinal and dorsal location. Gas is also seen in the bony canal, which could correspond to a ruptured L4-L5 disc.  The MRI of the lumbar spine confirmed images compatible with abscesses in the right paravertebral and psoas muscles, and two collections suggesting epidural abscesses located at L4-L5 and D12-L4. An alteration of the signal of the body of D12 was observed after administration of gadolinium, resulting in bone oedema compatible with spondylitis and probable spondylodiscitis.  In the combined body scan with Ga-67/MDP-Tc-99M there was pathological hyperfixation of both tracers in knees and shoulders suggesting an inflammatory-infectious process as well as greatly increased gallium uptake at L4-L5 and in paravertebral soft tissues compatible with spondylodiscitis with possible infection of adjacent soft tissues. On admission, empirical antibiotic treatment was started with ciprofloxacin, with subsequent microbiological confirmation (blood, urine and joint fluid cultures) of the presence of Escherichia coli, with a similar antibiogram. During the first few days of treatment, the patient's symptoms improved slightly, coinciding with the introduction of antibiotics and antipyretics. On the 10th day of admission, the fever reappeared and the general condition progressively worsened. On the 12th day of admission, the patient presented atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cardiorespiratory arrest without response to resuscitation manoeuvres. The diagnosis was E. coli urinary tract infection complicated by polyarticular septic arthritis, spondylodiscitis, epidural abscesses, psoas and dorso-lumbar musculature.   "
"A 39-year-old woman with a history of a diffuse normofunctioning goitre, calcified uterine myoma, normal menstrual periods, an uneventful pregnancy and vaginal delivery, who came to the emergency department for colicky abdominal pain together with abdominal distension and several liquid stools over 48 hours. The patient reported two similar episodes in the last year, which resolved spontaneously within a few hours, with no other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination showed good general condition, with haemodynamic stability, abdomen without scars, distended and tympanised, painful on palpation in the right hemiabdomen, especially in the right lower quadrant, with no signs of peritoneal irritation and no palpable masses or visceromegaly, decreased peristalsis. The requested blood test showed discrete leukocytosis with a predominance of granulocytes and CRP 3.7mg/dl, with the rest of the tests (glucose, ions, renal function, liver enzymes, amylase, urine system, etc.) being normal. An abdominal X-ray showed dilatation of the small intestine loops (ID), with hydro-aerial levels and absence of gas in the colon and rectal ampulla, uterine calcifications suggestive of myoma. Abdominal ultrasound showed abundant gas and hyperperistalsis in the ID and minimal free fluid between the intestinal loops. The abdominal CT scan showed marked dilatation of the loops of the ID, which respected the terminal ileum, with a change in calibre in the preterminal ileum at the level of the FID, a non-dilated colon with opacification with oral contrast, accumulation of free fluid at the level of the pouch of Douglas, and a myomatous uterus with lumpy calcifications.  Initially, conservative treatment was applied with nasogastric tube, fluid therapy and analgesia, with no clinical or radiological improvement in the following hours, so surgery was decided. The approach was performed via infraumbilical midline laparotomy, revealing a moderate amount of free serous fluid, dilation of the loops of ID and stenosing thickening in the terminal ileum, about 10 cm from the ileocaecal valve, with a tumour appearance, retraction of the serosal surface and mesenteric lymphadenopathies. Pelvic examination revealed a myomatous uterus. Ileocaecal resection and mechanical latero-lateral anastomosis were performed, as well as drainage of the fluid from the cul-de-sac of Douglas. Samples were sent to Anatomical Pathology for histological study, and it was reported that abundant adhesions and fibrosis were observed in the wall of the terminal ileum and cecum. In depth, islets and nests of endometrioid glandular epithelium and endometrial stroma were observed. Focally there is an increased inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis. The intestinal wall shows hypertrophy of the muscle layers, lymph nodes without histologically evident lesions. With the diagnosis of ileocecal endometriosis, and after a favourable postoperative course without complications, the patient was referred to the gynaecology and obstetrics department to assess the start of treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and follow-up.   "
"27-year-old pregnant woman, blood group A positive, with a personal history of meningitis at the age of 3, curettage for molar pregnancy (G1P0A1) in her first pregnancy in 2005 and smoker of 10-20 cigarettes/day. No previous history of transfusions. In the ultrasound performed at 35 weeks' gestation, bilateral foetal hydrocephalus and oligohydramnios were detected, so a caesarean section was scheduled for 36 weeks' gestation. The previous analytical study showed a positive serology (IgM) for Parvovirus B19. Examination of the newborn after caesarean section revealed a good general condition, with an Apgar test of 8 and 9 points in the first and fifth minute, respectively, small haematomas on the left shoulder and buttock, macrocephaly with anterior fontanel under tension and prominence of the cephalic veins. The haemogram showed severe tombocytopenia (9 x 109/L). Given the clinical suspicion of NAFLD, an aliquot of irradiated apheresis platelet concentrate of unknown HPA-1a phenotype was transfused and treatment was started with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) at a dose of 1 g/kg x 2 days, with a very good response (platelets > 100 x 109/L, which were maintained throughout the hospital stay). An immunohaematological study was requested from the Blood Transfusion Centre of Navarra, as well as a search for platelets from a negative HPA-1a donor. Brain ultrasound showed severe hydrocephalus secondary to intraventricular haemorrhage, which required the placement of an external shunt catheter, through which pressurised haemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid was collected. Subsequent evolution was torpid, with ventriculitis and seizures, which required treatment with antibiotic therapy and phenobarbital, respectively, and implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt valve. During his admission, an aliquot of leucodepleted and irradiated red blood cell concentrate was transfused. The immunohaematological study performed at the Centro de Transfusión Sanguínea de Navarra confirmed the negative HPA-1a phenotype in the mother and positive in the newborn, as well as the presence of antibodies with anti-HPA-1a specificity in the maternal serum and in the newborn.   "
"We present the case of a 26-year-old female patient who came for consultation with pain in the right wrist of 7 years' duration with no history of trauma. The pain at rest was mild, but increased with manual activity and especially with forced extension of the wrist. It did not improve with symptomatic medical treatment. The dorsal radiocarpal joint interline and the proximal pole of the scaphoid were painful on palpation. There was no palpable tumour. Wrist mobility was slightly limited in the last degrees of flexion and extension. The radiological image showed a radiolucent, well-defined, oval lesion located in the mid-dorsal third of the scaphoid. The CT scan showed the dorsal eccentric location of the lesion and a stippling compatible with calcifications. The MRI showed signs of marked bone oedema in the scaphoid, except in the distal third, and adjacent synovitis. With the diagnosis of a suspected benign lesion (enchondroma, intraosseous ganglion), surgical treatment of the lesion was decided. This was performed via a dorsal approach to the scaphoid. After opening the joint capsule, the dorsal aspect of the distal epiphysis of the radius and the scaphoid was exposed, revealing a pearly, wine-red tumour in the middle third of the scaphoid, occupying the dorsal crest of the navicular bone. Exhaustive curettage of the lesion was performed and the defect was filled with cancellous bone graft from the iliac crest.  The remitted material consisted of islets of cartilage matrix surrounded by abundant cellular tissue consisting of pseudo-chondroblastic cells. These cells were round or ovoid with hyperchromatic nuclei, clear or moderately eosinophilic cytoplasm and a clear plasma membrane. Cell pleomorphism was minimal and the mitotic index very low. Some cells contained iron. Among the pseudochondroblastic cells there were abundant osteoclast-like giant cells. In some areas there were areas of irregular calcification. There were also some areas of cystic transformation resembling aneurysmal cysts. The pathological diagnosis was carpal scaphoid chondroblastoma.  After surgical treatment, the wrist was immobilised with an antebrachial splint for 3 weeks and the patient was subsequently referred to the Rehabilitation Service. At the 3-month check-up, complete recovery of wrist mobility and radiological image of bone consolidation of the iliac crest autograft were observed. Two years after surgical treatment there is no evidence of recurrence and there is still complete disappearance of pain with mobility of the wrist similar to the contralateral one, as well as a completely normalised radiological image of the scaphoid.   "
"We present the case of a 30-month-old girl who came to the emergency department for presenting in the last two days with slight gait instability and intention tremor. The parents reported that three weeks earlier a mild generalised rash without fever had appeared, which resolved spontaneously in a few days. His personal history included no known allergies or previous trauma and his vaccination schedule was up to date, including varicella (chickenpox). Her psychomotor development was normal. She was re-evaluated 48 hours later, highlighting a worsening of ataxia that prevented her from standing upright, associated with severe irritability and irregular sleep. Physical examination on admission showed the patient to be in good nutritional condition and there were no meningeal signs, external signs of trauma or other pathological findings. The neurological examination revealed slurred but intelligible speech appropriate to the context, cerebellar ataxia, and intense and generalised intention tremor. Cranial nerves, strength, muscle tone and osteotendinous reflexes were normal and symmetrical. On admission, electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain tomography (CT) with iodine contrast were performed, which revealed no electroencephalographic or structural abnormalities. Urine toxins were negative. Lumbar puncture showed mild lymphorrhoea with negative biochemistry and cultures, including Herpes group, neurotropic virus and Borrelia. Serology for Herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr, Varicella-zoster, enterovirus, Salmonella sp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Borrelia burgdoferi showed no pathological findings. On the fifth day after symptom onset, the patient presented with intention tremor and severe truncal ataxia that made sitting difficult. The tremor was aggravated by probable intentionally reinforcing myoclonus and the irritability was extreme. Rapid, saccadic, multidirectional, chaotic but conjugated eye movements then appeared, which were also visible with the eyes closed, and which decreased when the patient was able to fixate his gaze. Given the clinical diagnosis of opsoclonus (SOMA), the search for a possible tumour was initiated. An abdominal ultrasound was requested, with normal results, and a simple chest X-ray showed a left parasternal thoracic mass. A thoracic CT scan showed a left paravertebral intrathoracic mass, compatible with NCT, confirmed after surgery as localised ganglioneuroblastoma. Neuron-specific enolase in blood and 24-hour urine catecholamines were also requested and found to be normal.  The opsoclonus decreased after initiation of high-dose oral prednisone (2 mg/kg/day), and was no longer observed 15 days after surgery. Ataxia and irritability improved markedly, but one year later she still requires treatment with oral prednisone at minimal daily doses for relapses of mild gait instability and irritability, with no evidence of tumour recurrence to date. His psychomotor development continues to progress normally.   "
"A 77-year-old male patient, non-allergic, ex-smoker, with a personal history of dilated cardiomyopathy of enolic origin, for which he underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation nine years ago. In NYHA functional class I since the last annual check-up. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute (bpm), signs of left atrial dilatation and bifascicular block with right bundle branch block and left bundle branch hemiblock. Chest X-ray showed median sternotomy sutures, atheromatosis at the level of the atrial arch and cardiovascular silhouette within normal limits. A mildly hyperinflated chest suggestive of pulmonary emphysema with bilateral hilar prominence that appeared vascular was described. Transthoracic echocardiography showed that the global and regional systolic function of the transplanted heart was preserved (ejection fraction, EF: 0.61). An end-diastolic volume (EDV) of 73 ml, end-systolic volume (ESV) of 28 ml and myocardial mass of 93 grams were estimated. The ventricular filling pattern was that of the transplanted heart. There were no signs of elevated filling pressure. Dobutamine stress echocardiography was normal. The ischaemia challenge test was negative for myocardial ischaemia. In order to study the coronary arteries and to rule out graft vasculopathy, FDCT coronary angiography was performed with the following parameters: 120 kV, 350 mAs effective for each tube, CTDIvol= 41 mGy. Seventy ml of iodinated contrast (Iomeron 400, 400 mgI/ml, Bracco, Milan, Italy) was administered through a right antecubital vein. During the scan the subject's mean heart rate was 80 bpm (range 78-83 bpm). The duration of apnoea was eight seconds. This examination showed left dominance with normal coronary arteries, without significant stenosis. The right coronary artery was of thin calibre, especially in its middle and distal thirds. An intermediate branch or bisector was observed as an anatomical variant. Calculation of left ventricular function by HRCT showed parameters superimposable to those obtained by echocardiography. Cardiac function was within normal limits with EF: 0.61, VTD 61 ml, VTS 24 ml and myocardial mass of 88 grams. No regional contractility abnormalities were observed. Since stress echocardiography was negative for myocardial ischaemia and non-invasive FDCT coronary angiography showed normal epicardial coronary arteries, conventional coronary angiography was discouraged.   "
"A 77-year-old man was referred to the hospital emergency department from his health centre for assessment of haematemesis. The patient's personal history included high gastrointestinal bleeding two years earlier, in the context of taking aspirin due to a catarrhal process, as well as repeated renoureteral crises (CRU) and asthma. No further information was available at the time regarding his personal history. He was taking anti-inflammatory-bronchodilator inhalation treatment; of his own volition the patient had recently discontinued his usual treatment with omeprazole. Diagnosed three days before with CRU at his health centre for colicky low back pain radiating to the left lower quadrant (LQ), he had received intramuscular diclofenac and aspirin on demand, with partial relief. On presentation of haematemesis, he was referred for assessment. In the emergency department, the patient reported, in addition to this radiating lumbar pain, which he recognised as having similar characteristics to previous CRU, the presentation in the last eight hours of heartburn, as well as trembling when getting out of bed and instability, which had led to a fall and nasal trauma. He had also presented three vomits of bloody content during this period. Physical examination revealed good general condition, BP 70/50 mm Hg with normal capillary refill, HR 90 bpm, tachycardia 36º C; nauseous, with pallor concomitant with nausea, but basically normal colour; wound in nasal bridge with traces of bleeding in nostrils and ""coffee grounds"" in labial commissures; abdomen painful to deep palpation in CII, with no signs of peritoneal irritation or apparent masses and negative rectal examination for blood and melena. Samples were taken for laboratory and cross-matching tests and serum therapy was started via two peripheral venous lines, which managed to raise the blood pressure without normalising it. Blood tests showed Hb, 12.9 g/dL, Ht. 36.1%, leukocytes 27,500/µL with 87% neutrophils, platelets and coagulation normal; urea 52 mg/dL, creatinine 2.86 g/dL; the rest normal. Given this situation of haemodynamic instability and haematemesis in a patient with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and current treatment with potentially gastrolesive drugs, an urgent endoscopy was requested. Immediate endoscopy revealed an oesophagus with clearly ischaemic mucosa from 30 cm and necrotic up to 38 cm, as well as a normal fundus, gastric body, incisura and antrum, with some minimal haematic debris. During endoscopy the patient went into cardiorespiratory arrest due to pulseless electrical activity. Resuscitation manoeuvres were unsuccessful and the patient died. Necropsy revealed acute necrotising erosive oesophagitis in the distal 14 cm and aortic arteriosclerosis, predominantly abdominal and iliac bifurcation, with saccular aneurysm in the abdominal aorta 13 cm long and 8 cm in diameter ruptured, massive retroperitoneal haemorrhage of approximately 3,000 cc and extension to the peritoneal cavity.   "
"The patient was a 43-year-old woman from Bolivia who attended the Emergency Department of the Hospital de Navarra after presenting at home with a generalised convulsive seizure, witnessed by family members, with a subsequent confusional period and intense bilateral headache. Prior to the seizure, one hour earlier, she had had paresthesia in her right hand. She had no family history or personal history of interest. On physical examination, he had normal pressure, frequency and temperature constants and a Glasgow Glasgow Glasgow score of 15. No neurological focality was found. The patient was sweating, with associated anxiety, which was successfully resolved with 0.25 mg of alprazolam. The rest of the examination was normal and she did not present a new seizure. In the emergency department, an ECG and chest X-ray were performed, both of which were normal, and blood tests with biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation tests, also within normal parameters. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed, which revealed a 3 cm diameter cystic lesion in the left fronto-parietal region, which did not capture contrast, with nodular calcifications in its periphery. The patient was admitted to neurosurgery with a suspected diagnosis of NCC.  During his admission, the study was completed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), which was normal, a cranial MRI, which confirmed the existence of cysticerci in the vesicular phase, and an X-ray of the thigh, with several small calcifications and morphology compatible with cysticerci. Treatment was started with dexamethasone, albendazole and oxcarbazepine, with good tolerance, and he was discharged with the diagnosis of left rolandic epilepsy secondary to systemic cysticercosis and completed outpatient treatment for one month with albendazole, maintaining the anti-epileptic treatment indefinitely, without presenting new seizures.   "
"A 36-year-old woman, with no previous history, who started with paraesthesia in the thumb of the right hand followed, 2 days later, by weakness in pincer movement. Two days later, she developed dorsiflexion paresis of the left foot and painful paresthesia on the dorsum of the left foot. She was admitted one week after the start of the week of evolution, with grade 3 paresis on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale of the right opponens and abductor pollicis brevis (ACP) and grade 4 MRC of the muscles dependent on the left external popliteal sciatic muscle (CPE) together with tactile and painful hypoaesthesia in the first and second fingers of the right hand and on the dorsum of the left foot. He was in good general condition with no fever, skin lesions or adenopathies. Five days after admission, new neurological alterations appeared, consisting of grade 3 MRC paresis of the deltoid and left triceps brachii and paraesthesia in the external face of the left arm and both calves. Complementary studies performed included erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), haemogram, elemental biochemistry of blood and urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study, coagulation study including platelets, mean platelet volume, prothrombin time, International Normalised Ratio (INR) and fibrinogen, proteinogram, immunoglobulins, complement C3 and C4 fractions, cryoglobulins, antibody antibody antibody, antibody antibody antibody, immunoglobulin antibody, antibody antibody antibody antibody, antibody antibody antibody antibody, antibody antibody antibody antibody, cryoglobulins, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies IgG and IgM and anti-ganglioside GM1 and GD1b, rheumatoid factor, serology for lues (RPR), Borrelia burgdorferi and hepatitis B and C, Mantoux, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, brain, thoracic and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The findings of these examinations were within the normal range. During admission, two neurophysiological studies were performed, as detailed in table 1. The first, performed 9 days after the onset of symptoms, highlighted the absence of motor potential (MP) of the left SPC and a reduction in the amplitude of the right median MP with wrist, elbow and axillary stimuli compared to that obtained with palmar stimulation. The electromyogram (EMG) of the right PCA showed a simple maximal effort pattern with few motor unit potentials (MUPs) of normal characteristics and no spontaneous activity. No spontaneous or voluntary activity was recorded in the left tibialis anterior (TA). In the second study performed at 15 days of evolution, changes in the sensory conduction of several nerves, which had previously shown no alterations, were observed. These included a reduction in the amplitude of the sensory potential of the left superficial peroneal nerve, absence of sensory responses in the sural nerves and in the right median nerve on stimulation of the third finger, and a decrease in the amplitude of those obtained from the first and second fingers. As in the first study, no PMs were obtained from the left SPC. The amplitude of the PMs of the right median was reduced, including that corresponding to stimulation on the palm, which had decreased with respect to that of the previous study. EMG showed spontaneous activity in the form of fibrillations and positive waves, abundant in the right PCA and scarce in the left TA and pedio. As in the previous study, the H-reflex and F waves of ulnar, posterior tibial, left medial and right CPE were normal and no proximal motor conduction blocks were observed in the left medial and both ulnar nerves, with normal values up to Erb's point.  A biopsy of the left sural nerve showed axonal degeneration and perivascular inflammatory infiltrate compatible with vasculitis infarction.  Treatment with 60 mg/day of prednisone was started, with subjective improvement of muscle weakness and painful paraesthesias. Subsequently, the prednisone dose was gradually reduced. At 9 months, 45 mg every other day, improvement of paresthesias in the lower extremities and proximal strength in the left upper extremity. Sensory-motor deficit persisted in the right hand and marked paresis in the left EPC territory. A third neurophysiological study performed at 9 months showed no significant changes with respect to the previous one, except for the reappearance of the low-amplitude sensory potential in the right sural nerve. In the EMG, moderate spontaneous activity persisted in the right PCA and left AT, with markedly deficient maximal effort patterns and PUMs with signs of active, irregular (polyphasic and polyturns) and unstable reinnervation.   "
"A 55-year-old man was referred to our hospital in November 2005 for odynophagia and oral bleeding. Physical examination revealed a necrotic ulcer 4-5 cm in diameter in the tonsillar pillar and left tonsil, which was biopsied and found to be squamous cell carcinoma. The CT scan showed ipsilateral laterocervical adenopathies, both submaxillary and jugulodigastric. Blood tests and other examinations were normal. A diagnosis of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (T3-N2b-M0, Stage IVa) was established and chemoradiotherapy treatment was started. Treatment consisted of hyperfractionated radiotherapy (120 cGy per fraction, 2 fractions/day, up to 7,680 cGy), and cisplatin, 20 mg/m2/day in continuous perfusion for 120 hours, between days 1-5 and 21-25 of treatment. At the end of treatment, both physical examination and CT scan showed complete response. The patient remained asymptomatic until March 2007 when he came to our hospital with asthenia, instability and abdominal pain followed by massive haematemesis with clinical and haematological involvement (Hb 7.1g, haematocrit 21.5%). Gastroscopy showed an ulcerated tumour in the distal oesophagus, over the cardia extending to the greater curvature and anterior and posterior face of the stomach. The result of the biopsy was epidermoid carcinoma compatible with metastasis of laryngeal carcinoma.  Throughout the hospital stay, several transfusions were necessary and treatment with somatostatin was started, despite which the bleeding remained active. Palliative radiotherapy treatment was then started with haemostatic intent, administering 20Gy in 5 fractions of 400cGy with good digestive tolerance and achieving remission of the bleeding episodes. The patient was discharged and remained asymptomatic for another 5 months, after which he died of metastatic dissemination.   "
"Female infant admitted at 7 months of age for a brief generalised tonic-clonic seizure, without infectious process or associated fever, which recurred with similar characteristics 23 hours after the first episode, while she was admitted. No focal onset of the seizure was observed, with maintained vital signs and a normal subsequent physical and neurological examination. The parents reported no personal history of note, she attended regular health check-ups and her psychomotor and staturo-ponderal development was normal. On admission, a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, acute phase reactants, brain ultrasound and electroencephalogram were performed, with normal results. Given the observation of a conflictive socio-familial situation, a search for toxins in urine was carried out, which tested positive for cocaine in two successive samples. The first sample yielded a quantified level of cocaine metabolites in urine of 1.7 µg/ml and the second, collected a few hours later, 0.4 µg/ml (our laboratory cut-off point of 0.3 µg/ml), which were negative 48 hours after admission. The father is a regular cannabis smoker, but the family members denied cocaine use at home or in their close social and family environment and pointed to the possibility of contact with environmental smoke in a closed room where they had been for hours before the onset of the seizures. Under surveillance by the assigned social worker since discharge, the patient has not presented again with seizures in the following six months and psychomotor development is proceeding normally.   "
"An 83-year-old patient with a personal history of hypertension and a mixed endometrial carcinoma, endometrioid and clear cell, stage T1N0M0, which was detected one year before the current admission due to metrorrhagia. The patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, completing treatment with adjuvant brachytherapy, which was completed 5 months before the current admission. She attended gynaecological oncology outpatient clinics and has been free of disease to date. On admission, she presented with progressive asthenia, anorexia and weakness of two weeks' duration, disorientation and bradyphasia of two days' duration, as well as constipation, polyuria, nocturia and polydipsia. A control blood test at her primary care centre showed a calcaemia of 15.35 mg/dL (reference values [v.r.] between 8.8 mg/dL and 10.2 mg/dL). A blood test was performed in the ED showing a calcaemia of 16.1 mg/dL with an ionic calcium of 6.3 mg/dL (r.v. between 4.2 mg/dL and 5.4 mg/dL), with a normal physical examination, abdominal X-ray and electrocardiogram. She was diagnosed with hypercalcaemic syndrome and treated with rehydration, intravenous zoledronate and furosemide, with calcaemia decreasing to normal values between the third and sixth day of treatment3,4. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward where she was found to have: ESR 106 mm/h, albumin 3.16 g/dL, PTH 21.5 pg/mL (r.v. between 7 pg/mL and 82pg/mL), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 9.9 ng/mL (r.v. between 6.6 ng/mL and 46.4 ng/mL) with negative tumour markers. Given the patient's personal history of uterine neoplasia, a bone scan was requested, which was normal, and a thoracic and abdominal CT scan showed a 10 cm x 8 cm Douglas pouch mass with peritoneal tumour implants and pulmonary metastases. A transvaginal biopsy of the Douglas cul-de-sac mass was performed and confirmed a recurrence of her neoplastic disease. The patient is currently in a palliative care centre.   "
"A 69-year-old woman came to the clinic with repeated respiratory infections. The patient reported no allergies or toxic habits, she was hypertensive treated with amlodipine and presented hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. She had undergone hysterectomy with double adnexectomy 20 years earlier. She reported a clinical history of 10 years of frequent respiratory infections, predominantly in winter although also present in summer, consisting of cough, dyspnoea, wheezing and purulent expectoration. He also reported orthopnoea. Physical examination revealed rhythmic cardiac auscultation, without murmurs or extratonos and pulmonary auscultation with isolated rhonchi. Perimalleolar oedema was observed in the extremities. Spirometry was performed with the following result: FVC 67%; FEV1 56%; PEF 73%; FEV1/FVC 68%, positive bronchodilator test. Lung gas diffusion is slightly reduced, being 72.6% of the reference value. Chest X-ray showed kyphoscoliosis with no other abnormalities. The CT scan showed areas of emphysema and bronchiectasis in both bases, more evident in the middle lobe. Blood tests showed only a deficit of AAT (30 mg/dl). Fibrobronchoscopy was performed with no significant findings. With these results, an AAT phenotype was performed, which showed the ZZ type. Diagnosed with asthma and D-AAT, asthma treatment was started with significant improvement. Initially, D-AAT replacement therapy was not carried out, as she maintained acceptable lung function.   "
"A 45-year-old man, quarry worker for 23 years, diagnosed with complicated silicosis (PMF). Ex-smoker for 10 years (15 packets/year) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TBP) in 2000, correctly treated with recurrence in 2003. He had required frequent courses of steroids in the last 2 years. She presented to the emergency department for dyspnoea and haemoptotic expectoration of 5 months' duration. Physical examination showed febrile fever (37.3oC). Pulmonary auscultation showed rhonchi and bilateral wheezing. Blood tests showed haemoglobin 11.9 g/l; platelets: 515,000 / mm3; sedimentation rate 79 mm/h and C-reactive protein 50 mg/l. Arterial blood gases showed respiratory failure (pH 7.45, arterial oxygen pressure 59 mm Hg and arterial carbon dioxide pressure 35 mm Hg). Chest X-ray showed a bilateral micronodular pattern with clusters in both upper lobes. Computerised axial tomography (CT) revealed extensive bilateral interstitial involvement in relation to silicosis complicated by the formation of large masses of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), which showed cavitation in their interior not present in the CT 9 months earlier, with mamelon formations in their interior at the level of the right upper lobe (LSD). Fibrobronchoscopy showed no significant findings and bronchoaspirate cytology showed no malignancy. Sputum lowestein culture was negative and fungal culture was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. A CT scan showed that the cavitated lesion had shrunk in size after 7 months of treatment with voriconazole. The patient is currently being evaluated for lung transplantation.   "
"Male, 45 years old, quarry worker for 15 years. Diagnosed with complicated silicosis in FMP. Ex-smoker for two years, 25 packs/year. Pulmonary tuberculosis in 2007. He attended the Emergency Department in March 2009 with threatening haemoptysis, preceded by cough and brownish expectoration of 4 weeks of evolution. Physical examination showed normal vital signs and bilateral rhonchi on pulmonary auscultation. Serum tests showed leukocytosis (11,280 cells/μl with 80% neutrophils) with no other abnormalities. Fibrobronchoscopy revealed a large clot in the right upper lobe bronchus. CT showed bilateral and diffuse micronodular interstitial involvement, some calcified nodules, predominantly in the upper lobes and conglomerates that had increased with respect to previous studies, with the appearance of material inside them, as well as nodular and diffuse pleural thickening. Culture was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus in sputum and bronchial aspirate. Blood IgG precipitins were positive and galactomannan antigen negative. Embolisation of the bronchial arteries of the LSI was performed with control of haemoptysis and treatment with voriconazole was started with good evolution after one year of treatment with negative serum precipitins.

"A boy aged 9 years and 8 months, with no past history of interest, was referred to the paediatric emergency department from his health centre for headache and proptosis. Onset of symptoms 4 days earlier, with fever, vomiting, headache and nasal congestion; diagnosed at his health centre with sinusitis and on antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 48 hours, with no improvement in symptoms. He reported severe right frontotemporal headache and right eyelid oedema that had evolved into proptosis in the last few hours. Physical examination revealed slight proptosis of the right eye, with slight eyelid swelling, as well as obstruction of the nostril on the same side. The neurological examination revealed only a slight difficulty in conjugate gaze. Given the poor clinical course of the sinusitis and the appearance of neurological symptoms, an emergency cranial CT scan was performed with the clinical suspicion of a possible intracranial complication. The CT scan showed pansinusitis, a subperiosteal phlegmon on the medial wall of the right orbit and a small right frontal subdural empyema (1.8 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm).   After a joint assessment with professionals from the neurosurgery department, it was decided to maintain a wait-and-see attitude. Empirical intravenous treatment was started with cefotaxime, vancomycin and metronidazole. The primary focus (pansinusitis) was drained and the sinuses were evacuated via a nasal approach. All cultures were negative. The clinical course was favourable, with disappearance of the symptoms a few days after the start of treatment. The patient underwent serial imaging tests (MRI), which showed a gradual decrease until complete disappearance eighteen days after treatment. Blood tests showed normalisation of the infectious parameters, with leukopenia and hypertransaminasemia secondary to the antibiotic treatment.   Antibiotic treatment was discontinued twenty-six days after the start of treatment and the patient was discharged. Subsequently, he was monitored on an outpatient basis, with no evidence of neurological sequelae, and with absolute normalisation of the analytical parameters.   "
"We present the case of a 27-year-old woman of Chinese nationality, who did not understand Spanish, had no known drug allergies, no medical or surgical history of interest and had been correctly vaccinated as a child in her country of origin. The patient first came to the emergency department of the health centre for a pruritic urticariform reaction of 24 hours' duration. At this first consultation she was prescribed an intramuscular antihistamine and a delayed-release corticoid and was diagnosed with urticaria. One day later the patient returned to the emergency department with an increase in lesions, reporting intense itching of the face, scalp, trunk, upper limbs and genitals. Several polymorphous lesions with a widespread distribution were observed, with haemorrhagic crusty lesions and other vesicular-pustular lesions two to five millimetres in diameter, some of them umbilicated in the central area. In the central abdominal region there was a necrotic crusty lesion that the patient said she had handled. After examination, she was diagnosed with chickenpox. She was referred home after taking a smear of the lesions, explaining to her the respiratory isolation measures that should be taken with her non-immunised cohabitants. She was prescribed oral acyclovir 800 mg every four hours, five times a day, with nightly rest for seven days, and antihistamines. Seven days later, our patient attended the emergency department of our referral hospital for intense asthenia of 24 hours' duration with no other symptoms. Examination was completely normal, so in the absence of any abnormalities in both laboratory and radiological tests, it was decided to discharge her home. Twelve hours later, the patient returned to the emergency department with suprapubic pain and asthenia. In the anamnesis she reported dysuria of two days' evolution and oligoanuria, with no concomitant febrile process. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was completely normal. Abdominal examination revealed suprapubic pain with palpation of the bladder balloon with positive suction in both renal fossae. Suspecting acute urinary retention, a bladder catheterisation was performed, revealing an emptying of 1,200 cc. Blood and urine tests were performed with results within normal parameters. The abdominal X-ray showed the presence of abundant retained faecal debris. During re-evaluation in the observation room, the companion-translator reported a clear improvement in abdominal pain and said that the patient had been suffering from progressive loss of strength and weakness in the lower limbs for four days. The patient was re-evaluated, with marked cervical stiffness, normal cranial nerves, distal and proximal motor balance 5/5 in the upper limbs. In the lower extremities, flaccid paraparesis with motor balance 3/5 proximal and 4/5 distal. Osteotendinous reflexes with bilateral patellar hyporeflexia and abolition of Achilles reflexes. Bilateral plantar cutaneous reflex in flexion. Hypo-sensitivity in metatarsals below D5 (breast). In view of the presence of neurological alterations, a craniocerebral computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan was ordered, where no focal intracranial lesions were observed and the cerebrospinal fluid spaces, as well as the differentiation of grey matter and white matter, were normal. Subsequently, a lumbar puncture was performed where clear fluid was observed and samples were sent for laboratory studies, and the patient was admitted to the neurology department with the diagnosis of suspected post-infectious incomplete transverse myelitis. During his admission, a spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, which showed an area of T2 hypersignal located at the level of the cervical spinal cord (C5-D1) with a small dilatation of the ependymal duct, most likely related to infectious myelopathy. The lesion showed mild hypointensity in T1. This confirmed the diagnosis of infectious myelitis in the cervical spinal cord.  CSF serology results for Borrelia, Brucella, syphilis, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Varicella zoster virus (VZV) were negative. Serum serology results were congruent with CSF, except for Varicella zoster virus which was positive. Human Immunodeficiency Virus serology was also requested with negative results. Therefore, her highly probable aetiological diagnosis was acute myelitis due to Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. Since her admission, given the high suspicion of acute myelitis due to VZV, treatment was started with i.v. acyclovir for the first ten days with the addition of i.v. corticosteroid. The patient experienced a slow but steady improvement, and finally, after a month of hospitalisation, the catheter was removed without any episode of acute urinary retention in the following days. On discharge she continued rehabilitation treatment.   "
"Male, 34 years old, smoker of 15 cigarettes a day, with a history of peptic oesophagitis, hiatus hernia and non-allergic bronchial asthma. Diabetic father. He presented with severe abdominal pain in the left flank, pasty stools and increased abdominal sounds, and was assessed in primary care, initially interpreting the symptoms as possible acute gastroenteritis. Examination revealed slight pain on palpation in the left abdomen and a slight increase in peristalsis. Given the persistence of the pain, various complementary tests were requested. While awaiting further assessment, 10 days after his visit to primary care, he came to the hospital emergency department for a new episode of intense abdominal pain in the left flank, this time accompanied by diaphoresis, nervousness and skin pallor. He was assessed three times in the emergency department, diagnosed and treated as renal colic. Blood pressure: 136/95 mm Hg; heart rate: 89 l/min; temperature: 37.7o; sweating. Abdominal examination revealed left flank pain with positive left renal suction. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Chest and abdominal X-rays were normal. There was minimal leukocytosis (10,500), mild hyponatraemia and CRP=13. As there was no clinical improvement with symptomatic treatment, an abdomino-pelvic ultrasound scan was performed showing a tumour in the left adrenal gland. Following this result, a CT scan was requested, showing a mass of 6.5 cm in diameter depending on the left adrenal gland, which led to a differential diagnosis of pheochromocytoma or adrenal carcinoma.  Following this result, the patient was referred to the Urology Department and from there to the Internal Medicine Department for a functional study in an attempt to rule out pheochromocytoma. The determination of urinary metanephrines and catecholamines showed a reading of more than five times the normal value for total urinary metanephrines and urinary free catecholamines. A diagnosis of a functioning left adrenal mass is made, with marked elevation of metanephrines due to probable pheochromocytoma. Once the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was established, it was decided to perform a laparoscopic total left adrenalectomy after blockade with dosazoxin 4 mg/day. The anatomopathological analysis of the surgical findings showed that it was a malignant pheochromocytoma of 130 g and 6 x 6 cm, with extensive necrosis, marked cellular pleomorphism, abundant atypical mitoses (<50 x 10 cga), capsular invasion and a tumour thrombus in a large-calibre vein (the clamped vein), with no extra-adrenal extension. The trans-operative period passed without complications. During the whole process the patient presents normal blood pressure figures with good general condition, and no treatment is carried out.   "
"We present the case of a 36-year-old woman assessed in our clinic. Her personal history included a diagnosis of epilepsy at the age of 15 and menstrual migraine. The first of these was due to several episodes of loss of consciousness preceded by feelings of dizziness, sweating and tinnitus, which occurred approximately every two months. She was treated with valproic acid (VPA) for two years, during which she remained asymptomatic. The menstrual migraine started at the age of 21 years, usually with a marked vegetative cortex and severe vomiting. At the age of 24, after vomiting during migraine attacks, she began to lose consciousness again, from which she recovered spontaneously a few seconds later. However, on one occasion, while unconscious, she began to make guttural sounds and had a generalised seizure lasting one minute. She was evaluated by a neurologist, who performed an electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, all of which were normal. With the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy, she was started on treatment with zonisamide (ZNS) at a dose of 250 mg daily. The patient continued to suffer from episodes of loss of consciousness, although less frequently. They were usually preceded by tinnitus, sound distancing, palpitations, a feeling of faintness and weakness. At this time he came to our clinic for the first time. A new EEG showed right temporal slow waves and a single peak wave discharge in the same location after hyperventilation, without clinical symptoms. We continued the study with a tilt table test, during which she suffered a regular episode of intense dizziness with palpitations coinciding with a complete left bundle branch block (LBBB). She was therefore diagnosed with an intraventricular conduction disorder and a subcutaneous Holter-electrocardiogram (ECG) was implanted, and the SNZ was progressively withdrawn. In the following months she presented three new episodes of loss of consciousness, with stress as the only apparent cause. One of these occurred during sleep, awakening with vegetative cortex and, for the first time, was accompanied by urinary incontinence; another was preceded by asthenia and an ascending epigastric burning sensation, also associated with lateral tongue biting and subsequent confusion. The Holter-ECG reading of one episode showed a LBBB, but no changes were recorded in the other episodes. As the episodes continued and new clinical features were added (urinary incontinence and lateral tongue bite), we performed video-EEG monitoring and simultaneous ECG recording. The intercritical tracing showed the presence of slow waves and right temporal epileptiform discharges, sometimes in the form of prolonged bursts of rhythmic waves. During the study, she presented with an episode of self-limited dizziness, similar to those initially described, which on EEG recording corresponded to organised rhythmic theta activity in the anteromedial region of the right temporal lobe, then spreading to the ipsilateral posteromedial region. Coinciding with the clinical onset, a bundle branch block appeared on ECG. A brain MRI showed slight dilatation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle, with no other alterations.  Based on the data obtained, we concluded that the episodes were compatible with focal seizures of right temporal origin, in the context of focal epilepsy of unknown cause, as we did not find a clear lesion in the brain MRI. She started treatment with levetiracetam (LEV) at a maximum dose of 2,000 mg/day, without the episodes disappearing and with side effects (mainly insomnia and irritability), so it had to be replaced by oxcarbazepine (OXC) up to a dose of 1,800 mg/day. With this drug he has been free of episodes and without side effects.  "
"A 43-year-old male, previously healthy and asymptomatic, attended the thoracic surgery department in order to complete the study of a middle mediastinal tumour identified in a routine study.  In the pharyngo-oesophageal study, after the administration of barium contrast, a stenosis of about 3 cm in length was observed in the middle third of the oesophagus with well-defined contours and which reduced the oesophageal lumen by 50%. These findings are compatible with an extrinsic compressive process.  A three-way right videothoracoscopy was performed. The presence of a tumour was identified in the middle mediastinum at the level of the azygos vein (cephalic to this vein), mobile, hard, with no adhesions to adjoining structures. Dissection is started by opening the mediastinal pleura and separating the tumour from what appears to be the muscular fibres of the oesophagus (this is done using a videothoracoscopy hook and an electric scalpel). The tumour, which measures approximately 3 cm in diameter, is then enucleated. The oesophageal mucosa is identified at its deep edge and its tightness is checked. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 48 hours. At the review carried out 6 months after surgery, the patient was asymptomatic and living a completely normal life, with no dysphagia or symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux, afebrile and with normal respiratory function tests. The anatomopathological report of the fragment was diagnosed as an oesophageal leiomyoma. Macroscopically, it was 5 cm in size, irregular in shape, with a polylobulated surface and a certain tendency to form swirls. Microscopically, the tumour consisted of bundles of smooth muscle fibres strongly positive for anti-actin, multidirectional in arrangement, without cellular atypia or mitosis. Occasionally, hyaline amorphous material appears in the form of irregularly distributed droplets.   "
"A 54 year old patient who came to the clinic with elevated PSA levels, antibiotic treatment was recommended and a new analysis was carried out. After a result of 8 ng/ml, a prostate biopsy was recommended. The anatomopathological result was prostate adenocarcinoma Gleason 3+3= 6, confirming localised disease with a nuclear magnetic resonance. The patient's past history included previous appendectomy and inguinal herniorrhaphy. Surgical treatment was proposed by means of radical prostatectomy, with access via the retropubic and extraperitoneal route using the Walsh technique, and the operation was carried out without incident. During the first few days he presented with fever peaks of up to 38.1oC, symptoms of postoperative paralytic ileus with abundant vomiting on the second day, suspending the oral tolerance started on the first day. On the fourth day, an abdominal X-ray was performed with the presence of gas in the colic frame and hydro-aerial levels in the right colon. Discharge was planned for the eighth day, given the satisfactory evolution. On the seventh day she presented with pain in the right flank and reddening of the area with fever up to 39oC. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a liquid collection with abundant gas in the retroperitoneum, behind the second and third duodenal portions, accompanied by minimal pneumoperitoneum, as well as diverticulosis at the level of the descending colon and sigma.   In view of these findings, the existence of duodenal perforation in the retroperitoneal portion and an infectious condition was suspected, and conservative treatment was chosen. Drainage was placed in the collection by ultrasound, obtaining cultures of the liquid, with growth of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Candida albicans after a few days. He remained on empirical antibiotic treatment during the entire admission, based on the cultures. A nasogastric tube was placed and oral feeding was replaced by parenteral feeding. Follow-up of the collection was done by ultrasound, confirming intestinal sealing with the use of contrast in a gastroduodenal transit 30 days after placement of the drain, subsequently initiating oral tolerance. After good tolerance to ingestion and apyretic state, the drainage tube was removed and the patient was discharged 45 days after the operation. At 26 months he remains asymptomatic and with undetectable PSA.   "
"12-year-old girl with a history of prominent ears treated by otoplasty at the age of 8 years. A keloid progressively developed in both ears from one year after the operation. The keloids invaded the upper edge and posterior face of the upper poles. The right ear had a horizontal size of 3.2 cm and a vertical size of 2 cm, and the left ear was 2.7 cm x 1.5 cm respectively. The patient reported no pain or itching. Excision was indicated due to the large size of the lesions, with aesthetic and psychological repercussions. The operation was performed under general anaesthesia. Surgical treatment consisted of the following technique: an incision was made on the posterosuperior aspect of the keloid, from which a thin flap of the keloid skin cover was dissected, maintaining a pedicle of attachment to the normal skin on the anterior aspect of the ear. After lifting the flap to a suitable size, the remaining keloid was excised. The flap was sutured to the defect without tension. The size of the flaps was 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm on the right ear and 2 cm x 1 cm on the left ear. Pathological examination showed that the keloid nodules were covered by epidermis, and atrophy of the skin appendages was observed. Surgery was associated with other treatments, commonly used to prevent recurrence: intraoperative injection of corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide) into the surgical site, application of silicone gel to the resulting scars and pressotherapy with an elastic band. Silicone gel and pressotherapy were used for one year after surgery. The patient was monitored periodically.  The right ear flap had a small suture dehiscence, which healed by secondary intention within a few weeks with topical treatment. No necrosis or other complications developed. A satisfactory repair of the defects was achieved, with restoration of the normal contour of the ears. On the right ear a recurrence developed 5 years after the operation, forming a keloid in the operated area measuring 1.5 cm x 1 cm, which was treated with the same surgical procedure. There has been no recurrence in the left ear. At 18 years of age, both ears look good and the patient has regular check-ups.    "
"33-year-old patient with no past history of interest, diagnosed with ileal Crohn's disease in early 2005. He had been treated with claversal 500 mg/8 h and azathioprine at a dose of 150 mg/day since December 2005 for corticodependence. He was also being treated with quarterly oral iron, monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 and folic acid two days a week. Since then the patient was asymptomatic. In January 2007, an increase in cholestasis enzymes over time was observed, and it was decided to extend the study on an outpatient basis and withdraw azathioprine. Physical examination: Blood pressure: 100/60 mm/sec; Pulse: 70 bpm; Temperature: 36oC; Weight: 80 kg; Height: 180 cm; Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful, no masses or megaliths. Lower extremities without alterations. Given the persistence of cholestasis, the following tests were performed: Blood tests. Blood count and coagulation normal. Platelets: 108,000/ml. Liver profile: Transaminases normal. FA: 248U/L. GGT: 390U/L. Ferric profile and autoimmunity negative. Hepatitis B and C virus serology negative. Abdominal ultrasound. Liver diffusely increased in size, with smooth contour and diffusely coarse, heterogeneous and hyperechogenic parenchyma, without occupational lesions. Mild splenomegaly. Calibre and permeability of the portal portal normal. Rest of structures without alterations. Abdominal MRI. Liver diffusely increased in size, smooth capsular contour and homogeneous parenchyma in mid-level T1 sequences, in T2 sequences appears hypointense, with diffuse patchy areas, slightly hyperintense, without occupational lesions. Slight splenomegaly. Rest of structures without alterations. Gastroscopy. In the lower third of the oesophagus 3 small varicose cords were observed, which disappeared with insufflation. Given the persistence of dissociated cholestasis despite the withdrawal of azathioprine, it was decided to perform a liver biopsy in which a preserved general architecture was observed. Some portal spaces are widened with incomplete porto-portal bridging. Isolated centrolobulillary veins. No cholestasis or haemosiderosis. No macrophages. PAS diastase positive. Some portal spaces have a slight infiltrate of round cells that does not overflow the limiting plate. The irregular hepatocyte trabeculae show a regenerative and pavement-like pattern in some areas. There are frequent binucleated cells, vascular structures and dilated sinusoidal areas with a peliotic pattern. There is an irregular reticulin framework with areas of collapse. The histology described above is compatible with nodular regenerative hyperplasia.  The subsequent evolution, both analytical and portal hypertension data, was good with normal analytical normality and disappearance of the oesophageal varices.   "
"A 40-year-old woman, with no relevant pathological history. She attended the primary care clinic for dyspepsia with epigastralgia and retrosternal pyrosis of 10 days' evolution. The anamnesis ruled out dietary transgressions, intake of drugs or gastrolesive substances, and the presence of organic symptoms or clinical alarm data. Physical examination was normal. The patient was diagnosed with dyspepsia that was not investigated. Treatment was started with hygienic-dietary measures and omeprazole 20 mg/day for 4 weeks, and the patient was scheduled for a check-up. The patient reported a slight clinical improvement. The dose of omeprazole was increased to full doses and a prokinetic drug was added. The patient was recalled in 4 weeks for a further review, where the presence of mechanical oropharyngeal dysphagia was noted as an alarm sign. An EDA was requested as a matter of preference, which revealed the presence of an oesophageal exudate in the proximal 2/3 of the esophagus. Samples of the lesions were taken by brushing for pathological examination and culture, which confirmed the diagnosis: candidal oesophagitis.  The patient was treated with fluconazole 100 mg/day for 21 days and pantoprazole 40 mg/day orally, achieving complete remission. Given the diagnosis of CD, the study of its possible causes and associated entities (neurological, neoplastic, metabolic, systemic, immunosuppression, etc.) was completed by means of anamnesis, physical examination, complete blood tests (with thyroid, hepatic and renal function, diabetic profile, immunological status of the patient, serological study, etc.) and chest and abdominal X-rays. The results of all the complementary tests were negative. After completing the study, the only risk factor found was treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The patient was finally diagnosed with CD in an immunocompetent patient. In the literature reviewed, patients with CD related to taking PPIs had taken this treatment for at least 2 months6-8 (like our patient). We decided to discontinue such treatment after clinical resolution, and subsequently performed a follow-up EDA, which was normal.   "
"The patient was a 35-year-old man who was referred to the clinic for evaluation of a radiological alteration of the chest. He had no drug allergies, he was allergic to pollen. He worked as a plasterboard worker. He had smoked 10 cigarettes/day since the age of 14 (10.5 packs/year) and 8 joints of marijuana/day. He consumed alcohol occasionally. He had no family history of interest. During the last year, he reported coughing predominantly in the evening and at night when lying on his back, accompanied by white expectoration. He also had associated wheezing that improved with bronchodilators. He also reported dyspnoea on exertion. He had lost about 5 kg in weight. She reported asthenia which she related to work. She had a dog at home. He had not travelled recently nor had he had any known contact with tuberculosis patients. On physical examination he was in good general condition, eupneic with a baseline oxygen saturation of 98%. There were no adenopathies or acropacities. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed a diffuse linear interstitial pattern predominantly on the right. The study was completed with several complementary explorations: blood tests with all parameters within normality, including autoimmunity and negative serology, respiratory function tests (RFT) within normality, negative Mantoux, computed tomography (CT) of the chest showing the lung parenchyma occupied by multiple small cavitary-cystic lesions, widely distributed in both lung fields, with involvement of both upper and lower fields.  Based on these findings, bronchoscopy was performed and no mucosal alterations or lesions were observed. Three BAL scans were performed in the right upper lobe, which were sent for cytology, smear microscopy and lymphocyte subpopulations. In addition, four bronchoaspirate secretions (BAS) were performed for fungi, Pneumocystis, culture and Koch's bacillus. All results were negative. The bronchoaspirate pathology report revealed minimal inflammatory component, with no abnormal histiocytes or atypical cells. Immunohistochemistry was negative for S100 and CD1a. Given this result, a biopsy of the right upper lung lobe was performed by thoracotomy. Pathology was compatible with Langerhans' histiocytosis in the proliferative or cellular phase. The patient was advised to stop smoking. He was seen 3 months later and reported being asymptomatic with a gain of 6 kg. However, in the control chest X-ray the interstitial pattern remained.   "
"A 57-year-old woman, with no medical history of interest, ex-smoker for 15 years, referred from the Breast Cancer Early Detection Unit for a 3.5 cm nodule in the lower left quadrant of the left breast, without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis was made by biopsy, MRI and axillary ultrasound of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast with axillary involvement. Neoadjuvant treatment with standard chemotherapy with FEC 75 (4 cycles) followed by docetaxel (4 cycles). After treatment, there was no radiological response and surgery was performed, with a left mastectomy and Berg level I and II lymphadenectomy. The definitive anatomopathological diagnosis was infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade III, 2.6 cm, Her2-neu negative. Oestrogen receptors 98%. Progesterone 38%. P53 29%. Ki 67 35%. Her-2 0%. Keratin 56 positive 1/3. EGFR negative. E-Caderin positive 3/3. Androgen negative. BCL2 positive 2/3. It is a luminal B-Ki67 pattern with metastasis in 1/ 19 lymph nodes. In the immediate postoperative period there was slight haemorrhage externalised by drainage, and conservative treatment was carried out. On the seventh postoperative day, a debit of 400 ml was observed through the axillary drainage, with a milky appearance, suggestive of chylous lymphorrhoea. The chylous fluid was confirmed by a biochemical study (triglycerides: 800 mg/dl, total cholesterol: 47 mg/dl). A diet with fat restriction is indicated, advising the ingestion of foods with medium-chain triglycerides and simultaneously administering subcutaneous somatostatin every 8 hours for 10 days. With these measures, the quantity and appearance of the axillary drainage improved and normalised, allowing its removal 20 days postoperatively. No further complications were observed in subsequent check-ups, and the patient went on to complete oncological treatment. The patient is asymptomatic and free of disease after 37 months of follow-up.   "
"A 36-year-old woman with no medical or epidemiological history of interest was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for sepsis and meningitis due to type B meningococcus isolated in blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. She received fluid therapy support, ceftriaxone and vancomycin for 10 days with disappearance of clinical and analytical parameters of sepsis although with persistence of daily fever of 38o in the evening, well tolerated, with no other infectious focality in the complementary tests which included: serial blood cultures, urine culture, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound and cranial CT scan. He was admitted to the internal medicine ward to complete the study and evolution; he remained haemodynamically stable and in good general condition, fever of up to 38.5oC well tolerated, right subclavian central venous access with no evidence of infection, few petechiae in the lower limbs in a phase of regression, with the rest of the general and neurological examination being normal. The haemogram, haemostasis, renal, hepatic, thyroid and lipid profile were normal, with a ferritin value of 775 µg/dl, ESR 90 mm1 per hour, CRP at 23.8 mg/dl (VN <0.3 mg/dl) and procalcitonin at 0.22 ng/ml. Serology for hepatitis B and C virus, HIV, EBV, CMV, HSV types 1 and 2, Coxiella burnetti and Rickettsiae was negative; autoimmunity with ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, immunoglobulins and complement were normal or negative. Mantoux reaction was negative; blood cultures via central catheter, peripheral blood and urine cultures were repeatedly negative; control cerebrospinal fluid was normal except for proteinuria of 65 mg/dl with negative smear microscopy and culture. Fundus examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiography and thoraco-abdominal CT with contrast were also normal. A cranial MRI with contrast was requested, showing a discrete generalised meningeal uptake and multiple lesions between 7-10 mm, hypointense in T1 and hyperintense in T2 and Flair, in the temporal white matter, in the left external capsule, right periventricular, frontal and bilateral anterior parietal with marked peripheral uptake of contrast in a ring and associated perilesional oedema. Given the findings compatible with multiple brain abscesses secondary to meningococcaemia, an extensive literature search was performed (clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, bibliographic databases, meta-search engines and related non-indexed journals) which confirmed the scarce data reported regarding this complication. At this point it was decided to perform a PET-CT scan in order to rule out other possible findings/foci that could justify the persistence of the fever, which corroborated the hypermetabolic uptake of the brain lesions described, and the absence of uptake at other body levels.  Ruling out another infectious/inflammatory focus, treatment with parenteral ceftriaxone was maintained for 8 weeks, with slow but progressive disappearance of fever, gradual decrease until CRP and ESR normalised, as well as disappearance of brain abscesses in MRI control after finishing treatment, with no complications or recurrence of the condition in the subsequent outpatient follow-up.

"We present the case of a 4-year-old girl who consulted for a painful erythrotic rash in the cervical region of 12 hours' duration. The patient had general malaise, no fever, respiratory symptoms or other additional symptoms. She had been assessed 6 hours earlier as a possible prurigo, having started treatment with corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines. Physical examination revealed skin erythema on the neck, armpits, chest and buttocks, with areas of skin peeling in the axillary and cervical areas and some yellowish crusty lesions in the cervical region. He also showed erythema and palpebral and conjunctival inflammation, and the rest of the physical examination was normal. The heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure were normal. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (12,300 leukocytes/µL, normal formula) without elevation of acute phase reactants.  With a presumptive diagnosis of SPEE, he was admitted and started treatment with i.v. cloxacillin, topical mupirocin, i.v. antihistamine, i.v. fluid therapy and analgesia. The evolution was initially unfavourable, with generalisation of the lesions and extension of the erythroderma. On the third day, IV clindamycin was added empirically to the treatment, with a very favourable evolution of the lesions after 24 hours. Subsequently, the blood culture was negative and the skin and nasal smear culture was positive for S. aureus (penicillin-resistant, sensitive to cloxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and clindamycin). After six days of admission with parenteral treatment, discharge was decided to continue antibiotic treatment on an outpatient basis.   "
"This is a 59-year-old man, diagnosed with T2N2b squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, who was initially treated with three cycles of chemotherapy without remission, so that three months later a supraglottic laryngectomy was performed, with modified incomplete radical emptying of the left side. Pathology showed an infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma in the left hemiepiglottis with 8 of 11 positive lymph nodes of the internal jugular, subdigastric and left supraclavicular chain. He subsequently received chemotherapy and radiotherapy on supraglottis and hypopharynx and bilateral lymph node areas. Nine months after surgery, she consulted for a three-week headache associated with binocular diplopia and blurred vision in the right eye, with evidence of ophthalmoparesis of the third, fourth and sixth right cranial nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a mass in the posterior and lateral portion of the right cavernous sinus, with protrusion towards the prepontine cistern, well demarcated, with homogeneous gadolinium uptake and dimensions of 11x14.4x12.2 mm. The CT bone window showed no lytic lesions or invasion of the sphenoid wing or sinus. The thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was negative. The radiological differential diagnosis was schwannoma, meningioma or metastasis.  An open biopsy was performed with a transylvian approach to the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus where tumour invasion of the intradural space was observed. The anatomopathological result was squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequently, radiotherapy was administered as palliative treatment. Three weeks after surgery the patient consulted for dorsal pain without neurological symptoms. An MRI study of the spine showed focal lesions in the D4, D6 and D10 bodies suspicious for metastatic implants. Radiotherapy treatment relieved the headache, but he developed ophthalmoplegia, retaining only right eye abduction. The patient died nine months after diagnosis of cavernous sinus metastasis.   "
"A 66 year old woman underwent hysterectomy plus bilateral adnexectomy and lymphadenectomy for endometrial adenocarcinoma. Background: myotonic dystrophy type I (DM type I) or Steinert's disease, pacemaker for complete AVB, restrictive lung disease requiring nocturnal non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), chronic non-viral liver disease with hypertransaminasemia being monitored by the digestive tract, hypothyroidism being treated with levothyrosine and high blood pressure being treated with candesartan. Previous surgical interventions: cholecystectomy by laparotomy 20 years ago and bilateral cataract surgery, both without complications. - ECG: sinus rhythm. Ventricular capture of pacemaker. Complete left bundle branch block. - Chest X-ray: restrictive pattern. Slight left pleural effusion. - Spirometry: FEV1 0.88 l (45.3%), FVC 1.16 L (49.6%), FEV1/FVC = 0.76. - Arterial blood gases: pH 7.44, PO2 53 mmHg, PCO2 51 mmHg, HCO3 34.6 mmol/l. - Haemogram: Hb 11.4 g/dl, Ht 35.6%, Platelets 85x1000/μl, Leukocytes 4.6x1000/μl - Coagulation: prothrombin activity 80%, aPTT 24.8 s. On arrival in the operating theatre, the patient was normotensive, normothermic and with arterial oxygen saturation of 99% with 02 in nasal goggles at 3 litres per minute. Premedication with benzodiazepines was avoided. It was decided to perform intrathecal anaesthesia with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, 9 mg, plus 5 μg of fentanyl; the technique was performed without incident. In the first hour, paracetamol 1 g iv, metamizole 2 g iv, dexamethasone 4 mg iv, dexketoprofen 50 mg iv and fluid therapy with heater were administered. During this first hour, the uterus and adnexa were resected. After 100 minutes and coinciding with the iliac and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, the patient presented pain, so it was decided to inject 10 mg of bolus ketamine (avoiding the use of benzodiazepines, morphine and propofol). A total of 40 mg ketamine was used, providing satisfactory analgesia without side effects. Ventilatory mechanics and O2 saturation remained unchanged during the operation, with the only respiratory support being the oxygen therapy she was already receiving on the ward (O2 in nasal goggles at 3 l/min). The surgery was completed after 150 minutes without incident. In the resuscitation unit, NIV (CPAP at 5 cmH2O), bilateral percutaneous transabdominal block (TAP) (7.5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine and 7.5 ml of 1% mepivacaine in each abdomen) and rectus abdominis block (5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine on each side) were administered, both of which were effective. Analgesia was prescribed for the inpatient ward avoiding opioids, where she arrived three hours after admission to resuscitation. During her stay on the ward, the patient remained stable and with controlled pain, and was discharged from hospital on the fifth day after the operation.   "
"We present the case of a 54-year-old woman, cholecystectomised at 23 years of age and with several episodes of residual choledocholithiasis resolved endoscopically as background of interest. The patient was admitted for epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, of hours' duration, without fever or dysthermic sensation. The patient had been discharged the previous day for residual choledocholithiasis that had resolved endoscopically, with no other pathological findings on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). On examination, he presented pain in the right hypochondrium and epigastrium on palpation, with no signs of peritonism, and with a slightly distended abdomen. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, hyperbilirubinaemia and mild elevation of transaminases, with normal amylase, as well as a marked elevation of 1 hour ESR. Parietal cell antibodies were positive and serum IgG4 was negative. Blood cultures were taken on admission and no microorganisms were isolated. An ultrasound scan showed several space-occupying lesions suggestive of liver abscesses, so it was decided to complete the study with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This showed multiple lesions in both hepatic lobes, between 1 and 7 centimetres in diameter, hyperintensely ill-defined in T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression, and with homogeneous or peripheral enhancement during the dynamic study with intravenous contrast, thus being compatible with hepatic abscesses. Dilatation of the main bile duct with repletion defects at the level of the distal common bile duct and common hepatic duct, together with a stenosis at the level of the hilar confluence, with no apparent cause and which had not been seen previously, was also observed. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage was attempted, but was not possible due to the absence of significant liquefaction. With intravenous antibiotic treatment, the patient became asymptomatic and remained afebrile. A new follow-up MRI scan was performed, showing a significant reduction in liver lesions, but without being able to rule out a neoplastic origin, as well as an irregularity in the origin of the left hepatic branch, which raises the doubt of an inflammatory or tumoural origin, in addition to choledocholithiasis. An ERCP was performed, from which two microcalcifications were extracted, confirming stenosis of the left hepatic branch, and samples were taken for cytological study, which were negative for malignancy. Finally, it was decided to perform an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the lesions, without incident. Histological examination of the lesion revealed a proliferation of myofibroblastic cells with elongated nuclei and cytoplasm, positive for actin and desmin by immunohistochemical techniques. There was also an increased population of IgG4-positive plasma cells, in some areas exceeding 30 per high-magnification field, with an IgG4/IgG ratio greater than 40%. All these findings were suggestive of inflammatory liver pseudotumour of the lymphoplasmacytic type, probably related to IgG4-related systemic disease. In addition, damage to the bile duct and some concentric periductal fibrosis without IgG4 cells at that level were seen in the non-injured liver.  The patient, after receiving antibiotic treatment for possible superinfection of the lesions given the history of ERCP, was discharged with steroid treatment in a descending regimen, with a good clinical-radiological evolution.   "
"An 11-year-old male patient consulted for left coxalgia of 2 years' evolution with mechanical characteristics that improved with rest. His personal history included Arnold-Chiari malformation, hydrocephalus associated with Dandy Walker malformation treated with ventriculo-peritoneal shunt valve and epilepsy with partial seizures. Physical examination revealed gait dysfunction with an antalgic limp and limb adduction and lumbar hyperlordosis. The hip had 20o flexion with a range of motion of 90o flexion, 20o external rotation, 10o internal rotation, and 20o abduction. Plain radiography showed discrete regional osteopenia ;. CT scan showed oedema and discontinuity of articular cartilage with synovial hypertrophy.  Arthrocentesis was performed under fluoroscopic control under general anaesthesia, but no synovial fluid sample was obtained. The study was complemented with arthrography which confirmed the existence of severe chondrolysis. With a presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic chondrolysis, rest, unloading of the limb with the use of canes and physical rehabilitation were prescribed. One month later, the hip was infiltrated with hyaluronic acid under radioscopic control. The evolution was torpid with persistence of symptoms despite treatment. Ten months after diagnosis, gentle joint mobilisation was performed under general anaesthesia, confirming movement of the femoral head en bloc with the pelvis, which was assessed as fibrous ankylosis. Due to joint stiffness, the option of periarticular tenotomy was ruled out. A year after diagnosis, joint stiffness improved slightly, so treatment was supplemented with soft tissue traction, with a favourable response in terms of pain control and flexion. The patient used outpatient traction for nocturnal periods, walking with English canes and continued with rehabilitation treatment for 6 months. After this treatment, the flexion attitude disappeared and he was able to lead a normal life without physical activity or prolonged walking, which caused episodes of pain and lameness. Four years later, concentric loss of 50% of the joint space with effacement of the medial line and local osteopenia was evident. The clinical evolution was favourable with disappearance of pain and almost complete spontaneous progressive recovery of function and mobility over a period of 6 years, as well as partial recovery of joint space. The MRI then showed joint narrowing with subchondral lesions in the femoral head and acetabulum, without signal changes in the medullary on both sides of the joint, with a destructive process of the articular cartilage. MRI was not previously performed due to lack of availability at the centre, but it would have been more appropriate to perform it to make a differential diagnosis. The range of joint movement at the end of clinical follow-up was -10o for abduction, internal rotation and external rotation with a dysmetry due to a 1 cm shortening of the affected limb. Currently, after 14 years of follow-up since the onset of symptomatology, the patient is living a normal life, asymptomatic, Trendelenburg (-), symmetrical and painless mobility of both hips (RI 30o, RE 65o), with incomplete recovery of joint space.

"A 46-year-old man with no history of interest presented with recent onset iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 11.3g/dL; MCV 79.8 µ3; Urea 29 mg/dL; Creatine 0.95 mg/dL; Iron 29 µg/dL, Ferritin 12 µg/L) at a routine check-up at work. The patient denied ingestion of gastro-lesive drugs and digestive externalisation of the bleeding, so conventional endoscopic examination was indicated (gastroscopy and ileo-colonoscopy), which was negative. After 30 days, the study was completed with an ECE, which was also negative, and the study was terminated and symptomatic treatment with oral iron supplements was indicated. After 3 months, the patient attended the emergency department for asthenia and melena in the last 48 hours. On physical examination he was pale and sweaty. His blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg and heart rate was 105 beats per minute, and a rectal examination revealed the presence of melena stools. Laboratory tests in the emergency department (Hb 7 g/dL; MCV 77.2 µ3; Urea 57 mg/dL; Creatine 0.74 mg/dL) confirmed the suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient was admitted for observation. In the first 24 hours, 2,000 ml of fluid therapy was administered and 4 red blood cell concentrates were transfused, with post-transfusion haemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL. Once the patient was stabilised, and given the suspicion of an upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, an urgent gastroscopy was performed, which was negative, and a new ECE was repeated at that time. In this last examination, the origin of the bleeding was identified from a gastric lesion of submucosal origin and ulcerated on its surface that was hidden between the gastric folds. The diagnosis of certainty was obtained after a new gastroscopy and after ruling out metastatic disease, the lesion was resected. The histopathological study confirmed the submucosal origin of the lesion (gastric GIST).   "
"A 49-year-old man, smoker of 12 cigarettes a day and ex-drinker for 3 years. He came to the emergency department for presenting progressive dyspnoea in the previous days, accompanied by oedema, dizziness and syncope, without accompanying chest pain or orthopnoea. The relevant history included a case of infective endocarditis on a myxoid mitral valve, complicated by valve perforation and severe mitral insufficiency, initially treated with antibiotics and subsequently with replacement of the mitral valve with a mechanical prosthesis by sternotomy. He was discharged 10 days before the current admission on treatment with acenocoumarol, bisoprolol, furosemide and amiodarone. Examination revealed a fair general condition, arterial hypotension (TAS 90 mmHg), jugular ingurgitation and hepatomegaly of 3 fingerbreadths. Laboratory tests showed a significant elevation of transaminases (AST: 5,550 U/L; ALT: 3,826 U/L) and LDH (10,375 U/L), with slightly elevated bilirubin levels (2 mg/dL). He also had anaemia (Hb: 9.2 g/dL), impaired renal function (Cr: 1.76 mg/dL; urea 88 mg/dL) and an I.N.R. of 9.86. Serologies for HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, EBV, CMV and autoimmunity were negative. Ingestion of drugs and other hepatotoxic products was ruled out. The electrocardiogram showed no alterations of interest and the ultrasound showed marked hepatomegaly with diffuse alteration of echogenicity related to steatosis, and the hepatic vascular study was normal. Given the suspicion of a possible cardiac origin of the clinical picture, an echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the presence of massive pericardial effusion, predominantly in the free wall of the right ventricle, where it reached 60 mm thick, and in the left ventricle with 29 mm thick. The right ventricle as well as the initial portion of the pulmonary artery appeared completely collapsed, evidence of severe echocardiographic tamponade.  In view of these findings, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Unit where diagnostic and evacuative pericardiocentesis was performed using an anterior approach (3rd left parasternal intercostal space) with extraction of 600 cc of haemorrhagic fluid, leaving a slight effusion located at the apical level (encapsulated). Samples were sent for biochemistry, microbiology and cytology, confirming a haematic effusion with a haematocrit higher than the plasma haematocrit, with the microbiological study and cytology being normal. At the same time, corticosteroid treatment was started with a good clinical response. Laboratory tests showed normalisation of creatinine levels (0.72 mg/dL) and a progressive decrease in transaminase values (AST: 304 U/L; ALT: 227 U/L) and LDH (568 U/L). Prior to discharge, a control echocardiogram was performed which showed mild pericardial effusion of fibrinous appearance, loculated, asymmetrically distributed, predominantly located at the anterior level and apex of the right ventricle, with no evidence of haemodynamic compromise. Given the good clinical and analytical evolution, liver biopsy was not necessary and he was diagnosed with ischaemic hepatitis due to low cardiac output in relation to cardiac tamponade secondary to post-pericardiotomy syndrome with haemorrhagic transformation.   "
"We offer a case of a complicated crown and root fracture, in which intraalveolar transplantation was used using Ledermix paste mixed with calcium hydroxide as a provisional intraconduit medication, following its evolution for four years. Description of the case:. In 1996 a thirteen year old boy came for consultation with a fracture of the upper right central incisor, of one week's evolution, without having received dental treatment. On examination, a complicated fracture of the crown-root was observed, reaching up to two millimetres below the marginal gingival margin. Surgical extrusion of the root was chosen. After anaesthesia with 4% Mepivacaine, an incision was made in the periodontal ligament and the root was luxated with an elevator, placed on the mesiopalatal and dystopalatal sides, respectively. The root was extracted and inspected for additional fractures. The apical fragment was repositioned, ensuring that the tooth was stabilised and the fracture was optimally exposed with minimal extrusion. The tooth was rotated to a position 90° from the original, which was considered the most stable, and then splinted to the adjacent teeth. To avoid interference during occlusion, part of the crown was removed.  One week after the initial treatment, the pulp was removed and filled with equal parts Ledermix and calcium hydroxide, and the crown was provisionally restored with composite. After six months, in the absence of signs of root resorption, the canal was definitively filled with gutta-percha, but the crown had discoloured, acquiring an intense grey colour. The non-vital teeth were bleached using a mixture of carbamide peroxide and glycerine (Endoperox®, Septodont France). The patient has been monitored for four years, with no signs of root resorption evident over this period of time.  "
"A 58-year-old man with a body surface area of 2.02 m_ with ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal failure secondary to nephroangiosclerosis. Informed about dialysis techniques, he opted for PD as he wanted home treatment. On 23-Jan-2004, a self-positioning PD catheter was surgically implanted without incident. A preoperative chest X-ray showed no pleural effusion or other notable alterations.  On 30-March-2004 continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) was started with 3 daily exchanges of 2,000 cc at 1.36%. After 48 hours, the patient reported drainage of 2,500 cc after 8 h. of stay, and so the pattern was modified to 2 daily exchanges with the same volume and glucose to minimise the negative effect of excessive ultrafiltration on residual renal function (RRF). After 1 week on CAPD, on 6-April-2004 he consulted for medium effort dyspnoea with orthopnoea of 48 hours' evolution. He had abundant diuresis, drainage of 2,300-2,400 cc per exchange and stable weight. Examination revealed a decrease in vesicular murmur in the right lung base, compatible with the existence of pleural effusion at that level, which was confirmed by a chest X-ray. With a diagnosis of suspected hydrothorax on CAPD, diagnostic thoracentesis was performed on the right, which showed a clear yellow fluid with protein < 1 g/dl, 17 leu/mm3, 40 haem/mm3 and 197 mg/dl glucose for a glycaemia of 108 mg/dl. Upon diagnostic confirmation of hydrothorax, CAPD was discontinued and the patient was kept on an outpatient basis without dialysis due to his good RRF. Symptoms improved the following day and a check-up a week later showed no pleural effusion. On 20-April-2004, after 2 weeks without PD, the patient was admitted and CAPD was restarted in decubitus with 6 exchanges/day of 1,000 cc at 1.36% to minimise intraperitoneal pressure, without initial recurrence of the hydrothorax. After 4 days without problems, the infusion volume was increased to 1,500 cc and ambulation was allowed. On 27-April-2004 he was discharged. After 3 days at home and 10 days after restarting CAPD, he returned to the hospital with a recurrence of the right hydrothorax. On this occasion, and after immediate discontinuation of CAPD, a haemodialysis (HD) catheter was implanted in the right femoral vein. The good evolution of the case during the first few days after restarting CAPD encouraged us to try again to solve the problem by means of peritoneal rest, this time for a longer period of time. On 31-May-2004, after a month of peritoneal rest, he restarted CAPD again with 5 daily exchanges of 1,000 cc at 1.36% and absolute bed rest, this time with a recurrence of hydrothorax only 48 hours later. CAPD was again suspended and HD was restarted. Given the ineffectiveness of conservative treatment, and in agreement with the patient, pleurodesis with talc was indicated, which the thoracic surgeons performed on 18 June 2004 with no further incidents or problems. A chest X-ray taken 4 days after thoracentesis showed no pleural effusion. After keeping the patient on HD for a further 5 weeks as recommended by the thoracic surgeons, on 26 July 2004, CAPD was restarted with 4 exchanges/day of 1500 cc at 1.36%, this time without incident. Currently, 15 months after restarting CAPD after pleurodesis, the patient is still on CAPD with no recurrence of the hydrothorax, using 4 exchanges/day of 2 litres at 1.36% and is really satisfied to be able to remain on the type of dialysis he had chosen.   "
"A 38-year-old patient diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis since 2004, corticodependent. That same year he presented with inflammatory bowel disease with bloodless diarrhoea, significant general condition and weight loss of 15 kg in one month, as well as digestive intolerance to treatment with azathioprine (Imurel®). During the last 3 years he has required several admissions due to severe bouts of diarrhoea (5-6 stools per day) with red blood. In June 2007, he presented a prolonged flare-up of ulcerative colitis with moderate-severe activation and poor response to drug treatment with criteria of cortirrefractoriness, at which point cytapheresis was initiated, receiving a session every 7 days for 5 weeks. The access routes were the antecubital veins of the arms, and during the sessions there were no complications or adverse reactions. From the second session onwards, she showed a notable clinical improvement and is currently receiving oral mycophenolate-mofetil (CellCe®) treatment.  "
"A 42-year-old patient diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis in 2003, corticodependent, with a first cortico-refractory episode in August 2003 and with cytomegalovirus superinfection, which was treated with ganciclovir iv. In May 2004, he presented a moderate flare-up with diarrhoea with red blood (2 stools per day) and since then chronic iron deficiency anaemia, which he has been treated with ferrotherapy. Endoscopic examination showed ulcerative pancolitis with severe involvement. He was treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. In June 2007 she presented with a new flare-up of disease activity with 10-12 liquid stools per day, abdominal pain and fever. Due to the progressive clinical and analytical worsening presented by the patient and the poor response to conventional treatment, it was decided to start treatment with granulocytoapheresis associated with cyclosporine iv. While the patient was hospitalised, 4 sessions were carried out, requiring the placement of a double-lumen catheter in the right jugular vein. A central catheter had to be changed due to infection (MARSA, contact isolation was performed), and the remaining 3 sessions were received on an outpatient basis. During these months, the patient has shown a rapid clinical and endoscopic improvement. He is currently receiving treatment with azathioprine (Imurel®).  "
"The first case is a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with Laurence-Moon-Biell syndrome manifesting hypogonadism with obesity, mental retardation, polydactyly, retinitis pigmentosa and renal failure. He started HD treatment at the age of 11, received his first renal transplant the following year, which failed due to venous thrombosis, so he returned to HD and required transplantectomy 9 months later. Due to vascular access difficulties, she needed to be referred to PD. During her evolution, the patient suffered several episodes of peritonitis and severe hyperparathyroidism. Her peritoneal membrane was classified as medium-high transporter. After 12 years on PD, the patient showed a poor general condition and peritonitis, caused by two germs (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), together with staphylococcal tunnel infection. The examination revealed a ""mass effect"" in the area of the subcutaneous tunnel, non-fluctuant, without inflammatory signs, of hard consistency and mamelon-shaped contour, producing a peritoneal eventration at the catheter orifice. Radiological imaging showed sclerosis and calcification of the entire peritoneal membrane, compressing all abdominal visceral structures. Specific antibiotic treatment was administered, the PD catheter was removed, and the patient was transferred to HD. Later, the patient had difficulty in swallowing due to vomiting. Once on HD, she developed two new episodes of ascites, secondary to peritonitis due to Echerichia coli, which required evacuation by paracentesis. Subsequently, he presented acute ischaemia in the right lower limb, due to femoropopliteal obstruction.  Surgical treatment of the peritoneal calcification and amputation of the ischaemic limb were ruled out. The evolution was unsatisfactory and he died shortly afterwards.   "
"A 12-month-old female infant came to the clinic with persistent crying, scanty cough and respiratory distress of about 10 hours' duration. She associated two vomiting episodes, partial refusal of food and rhinorrhoea. His personal history included three previous episodes of bronchospasm. His mother had a family history of asthma. Clinical examination revealed: weight 8.1 kg (P3), height 72 cm (P25), temperature 37.4°C, blood pressure 101/85 mm Hg, heart rate 148 beats per minute, respiratory rate 68 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 90%. He had a good general appearance, was irritable and did not calm down in the mother's arms. He presented with shortness of breath, with subcostal and intercostal tugging. Respiratory auscultation showed good air entry with bilateral expiratory wheezing and elongated expiration. Cardiac auscultation was normal. The oropharynx was hyperemic, with abundant mucus in the cavum. Otoscopy showed bilateral tympanic hyperemia with preserved light reflex. The rest of the examination was normal. Anteroposterior and lateral chest X-ray showed air trapping with the presence of anterocardiac air, a continuous diaphragm sign and minimal subcutaneous emphysema in the neck. A diagnosis of pneumomediastinum associated with bronchospasm was made and the patient was admitted to hospital. He was treated with oxygen through nasal goggles as needed, inhaled salbutamol and oral prednisolone. The clinical evolution was good, on the third day there were no signs or symptoms of respiratory distress, and the control chest X-ray showed a decrease in the size of the air in the mediastinum, so she was discharged. The sweat chloride test was normal.   "
"This is a 15-year-old female patient, with no family or personal history of interest, who comes to the clinic for the insidious appearance, 3-4 days previously, of erythematous lesions on the pretibial surface of both legs, symmetrical in shape, which have increased in number and size and some have begun to change colour, with a certain yellowish colour.  The patient reported a mild upper airway infection the previous week with no other symptoms. She denies taking any medication. Physical examination revealed no fever. Blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate: 60 beats per minute and normal cardiorespiratory auscultation. The lesions appeared as erythematous skin nodules, slightly hyperthermic and painful on palpation, ranging in diameter from 1 to 3 cm on the pretibial surface, with no lesions observed at other sites. The patient was recommended rest and analgesia with paracetamol or NSAIDs, and was referred to the dermatology department for a confirmatory biopsy. Given that the patient's physical examination was normal, the following complementary tests were requested to reach an aetiological diagnosis: haematology, formula, blood count and ESR; biochemistry with liver, kidney and thyroid function tests; proteinogram; calcium and phosphorus; rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein (CRP) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA). All values were within the normal range. A chest X-ray was also requested, with no pathological findings; Mantoux was negative; ASLO was negative and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) serology was positive for IgG, negative for IgM; pregnancy test was negative. After 15 days the lesions had practically disappeared. The biopsy gave the definitive diagnosis. Given the results of the complementary tests and the patient's evolution, it was labelled as erythema nodosum of idiopathic aetiology.   "
"A 13-year-old boy with no past history of interest consulted for frontal headache and nocturia in the previous months. On examination he presented normal height and weight for his age, bilateral gynaecomastia of 2 cm in diameter, pubarche and testicles of 3 ml. Ophthalmological examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an intrasellar expansive process (emerging from within the sella turcica) with a well-defined suprasellar growth, about 3 cm in maximum diameter, isodense with respect to the parenchyma, cystic in appearance with a solid pole and peripheral ring that were hyperintense after contrast injection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) defined the suprasellar cystic portion with proteinaceous content (slightly hyperintense in T1 and hypointense in T2) and the intrasellar solid portion isointense to the grey matter in both sequences and intensely enhanced after gadolinium. With the radiological diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, surgical treatment was indicated (the prolactin level had not been determined), and a macroscopically complete excision was performed via the right transciliary approach. Pathological anatomy diagnosed a pituitary adenoma with positive immunohistochemistry for prolactin and chromogranin A.  After surgery, the patient presented bitemporal haemianopsia with increased extension in the right visual field and panhypopituitarism, and was referred to endocrinology. Postoperative prolactin levels were 83 ng/ml, with no adenoma remnants on MRI, and treatment with cabergoline was started. Calcaemia was normal (9.5 and 8.8 mg/dl), so there is no suspicion of hyperparathyroidism or other tumours typical of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 1).   "
"A 4-year-old patient came to the clinic for consultation due to tiredness, the examination being normal; 5 days later, she had an urticarial rash on the lower limbs which disappeared on arrival at the clinic. Two days after the last visit, she developed a fever of 38.5oC, it appears that she has a cold and her tiredness has increased, and the macular rash persists, now affecting the lower and upper limbs and face, although we cannot visualise it at the time of the examination either. Physical examination: periorbital and eyelid oedema, more accentuated in the morning for the last 3 days. Mouth breathing with nasal obstruction, conspicuous sub-maxillary and laterocervical lymphadenopathy, congestive tonsils and on abdominal palpation splenomegaly and hepatomegaly measuring 4 cm. Conspicuous inguinal adenopathies of 2 cm in diameter. Abotarated facies. No exanthema. Neurological normal. Axillary temperature of 38 oC. The rest of the examination and cardiopulmonary auscultation is normal with no signs of respiratory failure. Laboratory results - CBC: red blood cells 4,000,000, haemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, haematocrit 31.6%, MCV 78.4. Leukocytes: 21,200 (neutrophils 2%, segmented 31%, lymphocytes 50%, monocytes 5%, reactive lymphocytes 9%, lymphoplasmic cells 3%); platelets 203,400/ml. - Transaminases: AST 245 and ALT 271 (mU/ml). - Paul Bunell: negative. - Urinalysis negative. At the first visit a chest and abdominal X-ray was performed: alveolar condensation affecting LSD and corresponding to pneumonia; possible hilar adenopathies; abdomen with moderate splenomegaly. Four days later, repeat examination: positive agglutination test (infectious mononucleosis). Hb 10.6; Htct 31.1; MCV 78.9; leukocytes 15,400 (segmented 27%, lymphocytes 60%, monocytes 5%, reactive lymphocytes 8%); platelets 246,800/ml. GOT/GPT 86/114 (mU/ml). Chest X-ray has improved with respect to the previous control (residual condensation in LSD and LMD). Tests pending from the first visit: pharyngotonsillar exudate: normal flora in aerobic culture; detection of Epstein Barr: EBV Ac anti-anticapsid IgM 36.3 (positive greater than 11.5), EBV Ac IgG 51.2 (positive greater than 11.5). Chest X-ray 10 days after the 1st visit: increased density in LSD of paramediastinal distribution associated with displacement of the minor fissure, suggesting segmental atelectasis probably residual to the infectious process. Diagnosis: infectious mononucleosis with pneumonia2-6.  "
"A 14-year-old patient came to the clinic with tiredness or fatigue, leg tremor, of 15 days' evolution. There was no history of fever, only morning cramps in the lower limbs in the previous days. Until then she had been dancing several days a week and led a very active life. Family originally from Chile. The child was born in New York and has lived in Spain for 6 years. Personal history not assessable. Correct vaccinations. No known drug allergies. No notable childhood illnesses. Menarche 2 years ago. Family history: relative with Berger's disease pending renal transplant. Physical examination: weight 51 kg; height 160 cm; BP 120/80 mmHg; heart rate 105 beats/minute; axillary temperature 36.8 oC. Good general condition, pallor of skin and mucous membranes (blond), no skin lesions. Small submandibular adenopathies. Normal neurological examination; normal cardiorespiratory system; abdomen with no appreciable findings, no visceromegaly, negative lumbar percussion cuff; correct hydration. Laboratory results - Haemoglobin 10.3 g/dl; red blood cells 3,880,000; haematocrit 29.7; MCV 77; white blood cell count: 11,100 leukocytes with 63.2% neutrophils, 25.1% lymphocytes, 8.2% monocytes, 3% eosinophils and 0.5% basophils; platelets: 672,600/ml. - Glycaemia 93 mg/dl with normal glycosylated haemoglobin; creatinine: 1.15 mg/dl; total cholesterol: 114 mg/dl; ferritin 133 mcg/l; sideremia 17 mcg/dl; bilirubin 0.29 mg/dl; alanine aminotransferase 8 U/l; aspartate aminotransferase 9 U/l; gamma-glutamyltransferase 12 U/l; triglycerides 62 mg/dl; TSH: 1.8093 mU/L (0.15-5.0). Under suspicion of renal failure7,8 he was admitted to hospital. Renal ultrasound: kidneys symmetrical but significantly large; no dilatation of collecting systems, normal Doppler and normal echogenicity. Renal balance: GFR (T) 70.67 ml/min/1.73 m2; GFR (SC) 50.02 ml/min/ m2. Proteinuria 20.71 mg/m2/hour. Diagnosis: mild to moderate renal failure with proteinuria without haematuria. Pathological diagnosis: tubulointerstitial nephritis with acute tubular damage (probably secondary to infectious process/drugs).   "
"A 9-year-old girl, with no history of pathology of interest, presented with a pruritic rash, with small papulo-erythematous lesions that in some areas became confluent, affecting the palms and soles of the feet. There was no enanthema and the patient was afebrile. As a history, the patient had been taking amoxicillin for 9 days due to LII pneumonia diagnosed at the referral hospital. The differential diagnosis initially included: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, viral exanthema (probably infectious mononucleosis), drug allergy to amoxicillin and toxicoderma. In view of the patient's clinical picture, it was decided to discontinue antibiotic treatment, an antihistamine was prescribed to calm the itching and a blood test was requested. The results of the first analysis were: ESR 31; Hb 14.1 g/dl; Ht 41; leukocytes 8,200 (N 44.7%; L 42.1%; M 9.3%; E 3.6%); platelets 564,000; GOT 91 U/L; GPT 220 U/L; ferritin 445; IgE 25.13 U/L; RAST to amoxicillin negative; serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and IgM negative. After this first analysis, the possible viral aetiology, probably a mononucleosis syndrome, became stronger, and after 2 weeks a control analysis was carried out with the following results: GOT 130 U/L; GPT 363 U/L; GGT 310 U/L; alkaline phosphatase 352 U/L; ESR 8; ferritin 138; Paul Bunnell negative; hepatitis A, B and C serology negative; toxoplasma serology IgG and IgM negative; CMV serology IgG positive and IgM negative; EBV serology IgG positive and IgM negative. At this point it was decided to repeat the analysis after one month, extending the study and ruling out the most frequent causes of transaminitis. The results were: GOT 228 U/L; GPT 483U/L; GGT 257U/L; CPK 87 U/L; alpha-1-antitrypsin 147 mg/dl; ceruloplasmin 3.23 mg/dl (22-58); plasma copper 43 mcg/dl (80-160); antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA, anti-LKM negative; IgA antitransglutaminase negative; alpha-fetoprotein negative; brucella serology negative, parvovirus B19 serology negative. After this analysis, the suspicion was centred on Wilson's disease. To complete the study, copper in urine was requested, with a result of 170 mcg/24 h (normal: 0-60) and a liver ultrasound scan showed mild steatosis. With suspicion of Wilson's disease, he was sent to the paediatric hepatology unit of the referral hospital where they confirmed the diagnosis and started treatment with D-penicillamine.   "
"A 6 year old male patient, with no pathological history of interest, came to the dentistry clinic for a check-up. The intraoral examination showed exfoliation of the four upper incisors without eruption of any of the permanent incisors. Palpation revealed a swelling in the vestibular cortex corresponding to the crowns of the upper central incisors, but these were located very far from the midline. An orthopantomography was requested to assess the position and eruption status of the upper incisors. The radiograph showed the presence of two midline mesiodens. The one on the right side was in a more apical position and larger than the left one. Both were vertical and conoid in shape. They caused a large interincisal diastema and prevented the correct eruption of the upper central incisors. The mother was informed of the need to extract the supernumerary teeth for the correct eruption of the anterior teeth, and the patient was referred to the maxillofacial surgery department for surgical extraction of the mesiodens. Prior to surgery, the patient had erupted 1/3 of the crown of the left upper incisor and the cusp of the left mesiodens. The maxillofacial surgery department decided to carry out the operation in two phases: first the surgical exodontia of the left mesiodens was carried out and the right mesiodens when it was in a lower position. The patient will require periodic check-ups to control the eruption of the teeth and to assess the need for subsequent orthodontic treatment to close the interincisal diastema and also to allow the eruption of the upper lateral incisors.   "
"A 13 year old boy, with no personal history of interest, who comes to the health centre for consultation because for some months he has noticed a lesion on his left leg that does not cause any symptoms and has not changed in size. She refers to a possible traumatism to this area two years earlier after a fall on skates. He is in good general condition and is asymptomatic. A bony prominence of approximately 1.5-2 cm is palpated about 3-4 cm above the left internal malleolus. There is no local swelling, haematoma or pain on palpation. There are also no distal neurovascular alterations or functional impotence.  A simple anteroposterior and lateral X-ray of the affected leg was requested, showing a bony lesion. The radiological report gives the diagnosis: ""The anteroposterior and lateral X-ray of the ankle shows a well-defined bony relief, at the expense of the cortical layer, with no apparent soft tissue involvement, in the medial aspect of the distal third of the left tibia compatible with osteochondroma"".  Given that it was an asymptomatic mass and had remained stable and conserved its size, it was decided to follow its evolution in the consultation room and in the event of possible changes to carry out an imaging test and/or to make an appointment with the traumatology department for a check-up.   "
"Eight year old boy born and living in Sierra Leone who consulted Saint John of God Hospital in Sierra Leone for a lump on the lower eyelid of the left eye with an evolution time of about one month. The father reported a history of contact with papaya leaves. On examination, there was a hard lump covering the outer two thirds of the lower left eyelid, with ulcerations on the skin surface and mucosa of the lower left eyelid. There were also adenopathies on both sides of the neck. The rest of the examination showed no relevant findings.  The impossibility of performing microbiological cultures in the field made it necessary to administer systemic and local antibiotic coverage as the first therapeutic option in case it was an infectious process. Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and topical tobramycin and acyclovir were administered. However, the most striking symptom was the stony consistency of the tumour, together with regional lymphadenopathy suggestive of a neoformative process. Finally, contact with papaya led to the possibility of contact dermatitis due to the latex exuded by these fruits when they are green1. A skin biopsy was performed and sent to a referral hospital. Pathology showed a fibrin and polynuclear exudate in the superficial area of the ulcer and granulation tissue in the deep regions, where histiocytes with herpes-like intranuclear inclusions and giant multinucleated cells with nuclei containing intranuclear inclusion bodies were identified. Skeletal muscle from the deepest biopsy site showed a non-specific focal inflammatory reaction. PAS staining was negative. The diagnosis was: ulcerated lesion with features compatible with herpes virus infection, accompanied by probably bacterial superinfection.  After three weeks, the lower eyelid tumour began to decrease in size, as did the induration, while the ulcerations healed. At one and a half months, the repair was complete.   "
"We present the case of an eight-month-old female patient admitted for a seven-day course of symptoms consisting of fever up to 40oC, refusal of food intake and vomiting. She had no family or personal pathological history of interest, and no known allergies. Physical examination revealed only small rounded laterocervical lymphadenopathies and pharyngeal hyperemia. In the complementary study requested, he had a haemogram with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate; C-reactive protein, 4.48 mg/dl; and normal sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), bilirubin, protein and blood gases. Blood, urine and stool cultures were negative and a pharyngeal swab isolated Parainfuenzavirus 3. An analytical finding that attracted attention was an AF level of 5252 IU/l. The parents were again asked about the cause of this elevated AF, with particular emphasis on the consumption of drugs, history of fractures or previous illnesses, both in the patient and in her relatives, but no new data were obtained. A new determination of AF was requested to check that it was not a laboratory error, as well as GGT, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and AF isoenzymes. This analysis confirmed elevated AF (6070 IU/l), with the rest of the requested parameters (GGT, AF isoenzymes, vitamin D and PTH) being normal. On the seventh day of admission, once the febrile process had resolved, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of Parainfuenzavirus 3 infection and hyperphosphataemia under study. He was monitored clinically and with periodic AF tests in outpatient clinics. Subsequent controls showed a progressive decrease in AF, she remained asymptomatic and with a strictly normal physical examination, so she was definitively discharged after six months, after presenting two AF determinations within normal values for her age, with the diagnosis of transient benign hyperphosphataemia of infancy (HTBI).   "
"A 13-year-old girl comes to the health centre accompanied by her mother, who asks to be vaccinated against tuberculosis. She is planning a study trip to the United States and is told that this is one of the requirements for access to education in certain centres in that country. She is informed that the vaccine is not available at the health centre, as it is not included in the current immunisation schedule of the Community of Madrid, as well as the possibility of attending the International Vaccination Centre. However, the mother stated that, due to her profession, she had access to this vaccine and only requested that it be administered at the centre, with the family themselves providing the vaccine. After the vaccine was administered and the girl complained of pain at the injection site, accompanied by a feeling of dizziness, she was attended to according to the protocol. On checking the packaging of the vaccine, it was found that the 2 ml vial that had been inoculated was not a single dose, the usual form of presentation of the vaccine, but contained 20 doses, which were inoculated intramuscularly, given the volume of the presentation (the usual dose for adults is 0.1 ml, injected subcutaneously). After verifying that the girl's condition is good and that her vital signs are normal, the family is informed of the error made and the relevant health authorities are informed. To obtain as much information as possible about the vaccine, we contacted the Institute of Toxicology and the Preventive Medicine Service of the Hospital Universitario 12 Octubre, the Management Department of the Reference Area, as well as the Infectious Diseases Service of the same hospital and the manufacturing laboratory (Pharmacia Spain) and the International Vaccination Centre. The girl was clinically monitored at the Infectious Diseases Department of the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre for six months, with analytical studies and immunity tests, all of which were normal both at the onset of the event and during its evolution. She did not develop any type of reaction at the injection site either in the immediate period or during the follow-up period, and was discharged without any incident. She did not receive any anti-tuberculosis treatment during her follow-up.   "
"Three-year-old boy, brought to the emergency department for having presented in the previous hour with two episodes of approximately one minute's duration, consisting of environmental disconnection, blank stare and generalised hypertonia; both episodes subsided on their own. Two days earlier she had started with diarrhoea and vomiting, and had not presented fever. She had no personal history of interest. His family history included only a six-year-old brother who had presented two febrile crises. Physical examination showed no evidence of dehydration or neurological alterations. Blood count, biochemistry and venous blood gases were normal. He remained under observation for 20 hours with no new crises and good tolerance to oral hydration. Rotavirus was detected in the stool culture. Subsequent follow-up with no new crises and normal psychomotor development.   "
"A 14-year-old male adolescent attended his paediatrician without an appointment due to chest pain in the left anterior hemithorax radiating to the neck. The pain started the previous day, began as mild and has been increasing, and the patient has observed that the discomfort worsens in decubitus and with deep breathing, and improves when he sits up and tilts his trunk forward. He denies fever or other symptoms, and has no medical or surgical history of interest. The physical examination is completely normal; however, the paediatrician performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) and decides, in view of the test findings, to refer the patient to hospital. Before reading on, take a close look at the ECG.  Following the routine reading1, the ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute. There are no abnormalities in the P wave or PR segment, and the QRS complex presents an axis within the lower left quadrant (between 0 and +90o, being positive in I and aVF) without morphological alterations. So far, we have not detected any unusual data. On analysing the repolarisation, we observed a QTc interval of normal duration, although the presence of negative T waves in leads V3-V6 is striking. We observed a marked decrease in the ST segment in V4 and slightly less in V5, without pathological Q waves or signs of ventricular hypertrophy. Given the patient's clinical and electrocardiographic findings, the paediatrician diagnosed acute pericarditis and referred the patient to hospital.   "
"A 13-year-old female patient, with no personal history of interest, consulted for bilateral palpebral oedema of three days' evolution. In the subsequent anamnesis she reported accompanying headache with slight odynophagia, without associated fever. Physical examination revealed bilateral eyelid oedema with no other ocular involvement, no oedema in other locations and tonsillar hypertrophy 2/4 with no exudates. In the following days he consulted again up to three times due to persistent and increased eyelid oedema, with no other symptoms. A urine dipstick was performed on several occasions without detecting proteinuria and a culture of pharyngeal exudate was negative. In view of the clinical findings and the negative results of the tests performed to date, a blood count, blood biochemistry, liver profile and urine sediment were requested, with normal results except for leukocytosis (18,460/µl) with lymphocyte predominance (61.8%) and increased transaminases (GOT 139 IU/l, GPT 184 IU/l). Ten days after the onset of the disease, the eyelid oedema resolved, with no evidence of fever, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. A blood test was performed three weeks later and the haemogram showed no abnormalities and transaminases decreased to normal values (GOT 22 IU/l, GPT 16 IU/l). Suspecting mononucleosis syndrome, serology for EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was requested, obtaining positive IgM against EBV, which allowed the diagnosis to be confirmed.   "
"A six-year-old patient consulted for periumbilical abdominal pain of 12 hours' duration accompanied by vomiting and a liquid stool. She presented with a low-grade fever, intense skin pallor and general malaise. Examination revealed a distended abdomen that was painful on palpation, with more intense defence in the right iliac fossa. Suspicion of acute appendicitis led to a normal haemogram and emergency biochemistry. The abdominal X-ray showed marked dilatation of the small bowel loops in the left hemiabdomen and scant right gas, findings compatible with reflex ileus. Ultrasound showed great distension of the right colic frame with liquid content that displaced the rest of the small bowel loops to the left and the presence of a small amount of free liquid in the interassoid and Morrison's space, in relation to probable intestinal under-occlusion or occlusion, although the possible cause could not be determined.  Laparotomy revealed the presence of a large ileal lymphatic malformation occupying practically the entire abdominal cavity, multiple moderate-sized cysts (5 cm in diameter) and a larger cyst (15-20 cm in diameter). The loops of the ileum adjacent to the malformation show some degree of volvulus and moderate ischaemic involvement that completely reverses after devolvulation. Ileal resection is performed, completely including the malformation, with end-to-end anastomosis. The pathological anatomy confirms the diagnosis of mesenteric cystic lymphangioma with a cystic mass of approximately 17 cm in diameter, with a smooth external surface and a vascular pattern on the wall corresponding to a single, multiseptate cavity filled with a slightly thick, cloudy yellow liquid. The wall is smooth internally and of a maximum thickness of 0.1 cm.   "
"We present the clinical case of a 13-year-old boy with no previous history of interest, who, after a kick against resistance while playing football, suffered pain and functional impotence in the groin and right thigh. The patient was in good general condition, without fever, and reported no infectious diseases in the previous days. He had no rotational alterations or shortening of the limbs, reported pain that increased with local palpation of the EIAI, the hip was free to passive mobilisation, but active movements were limited by pain. An anteroposterior X-ray of the pelvis and an axial X-ray of the right hip showed a fracture-avulsion of the EIAI. Joint rest, partial weight bearing with crutches and analgesia with ibuprofen 400 mg every eight hours orally was indicated. After three weeks, an appointment was made for an ultrasound examination, which showed a correct evolution of the injury. Following physiotherapy, after two months he gradually returned to sporting activity and was discharged three months after the initial injury.   "
"We present the case of an 11-year-old boy from Gambia who consulted for macroscopic haematuria predominantly at the end of micturition and dysuria of one year's duration; there was no history of fever. On taking the medical history, the patient reported a recent trip to his country of origin and several baths in lakes in the region. Physical examination was unremarkable. In view of the clinical suspicion of bilharzhiasis, the Microbiology Department of the referral hospital was contacted, where they indicated urine collection on three consecutive days, preferably at midday and at the end of urination (when egg excretion is at its peak) and a renovesical ultrasound examination was requested. The microbiological study showed Schistosoma haematobium eggs.  The bladder ultrasound revealed a parietal thickening that reached a maximum thickness of 9 mm in a radius of 20 mm, suggesting schistosomiasis, for which treatment with praziquantel was prescribed.   "
"A four-month-old boy was admitted with vomiting, diarrhoea and severe weight and body weight delay. He presented hypotonia, bilateral convergent strabismus and inverted nipples. Healthy, non-consanguineous parents, normal pregnancy and delivery. Since the age of one month she has had poor intake, growth failure and vomiting, with normal abdominal and transfontanelar ultrasound, chest X-ray, blood tests and urine culture.  On admission, rotavirus was detected in stool. After resolution of the acute process, nutritional support was started with artificial protein hydrolysate formula; later, the patient was switched to elemental formula as he continued to show poor weight gain. The study performed detected hypertransaminemia, hypoalbuminemia, decreased transferrin and ceruloplasmin, with normal hepatotropic virus serology and echocardiography. Given the suspicion of a possible inborn error of metabolism (IEM), a metabolic study was requested, while the patient required admission to the Intensive Care Unit due to the onset of symptoms compatible with sepsis (fever, hypoglycaemia, poor general condition and poor colouring). A cranial MRI scan was performed, which showed cerebellar hypoplasia. The result of the metabolic study confirms a congenital protein glycosylation defect (CGD) type Ia.   "
"The patient was a four-year-old boy with no history of interest, correctly vaccinated, who started a fever of 38.5 oC of 12 hours (h) of evolution, painful submaxillary adenopathies, erythematous pharynx with exudate, without catarrhal symptoms. In addition, he presented with raised micropapular exanthema in ""goose bumps"" affecting the trunk and the inguinal and axillary folds, slightly pruritic and slightly painful on palpation. Given the clinical suspicion of scarlet fever, a rapid test for Streptococcus pyogenes was performed, which was negative, so expectant management and a clinical check-up in 24-48 h was decided. At 24 h, the general condition had worsened with fever up to 39oC and persistent exanthema, so, given the high suspicion of scarlet fever, it was decided to take a pharyngeal swab and prescribe amoxicillin at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day distributed in one dose every 8 h. After 72 hours, the result of the pharyngeal swab was positive for Staphylococcus aureus (abundant growth) and sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. At that time, the patient was clinically well, afebrile and the rash had subsided, so it was decided to complete treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for eight days. Two weeks after the onset of fever, the patient developed scaling of the soles and palms ""gloved finger"".   "
"A three-year-old girl, with no personal or family history of interest, was referred by her paediatrician to the Allergology Department for presenting, for the last year, recurrent episodes of disseminated habonosis lesions without angioedema. The outbreaks appeared every one or two months, usually persisted for a week and were sometimes accompanied by odynophagia. The parents did not associate these symptoms with any possible external triggering agent, including drugs or food. Physical examination at the first visit revealed hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils, with no other noteworthy findings. Skin tests with a standard battery of pneumoallergens common in the region (including dust mites, pollens, fungi and animal epithelia), latex, food, plant panallergens and Anisakis simplex were negative. General laboratory tests (biochemistry, haemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid hormones and urine) were normal, as were serum immunoglobulin classes IgA, IgM and IgG. Total IgE was 104.5 IU/ml (normal reference values 100-120 IU/ml). Anti-streptolysin O antibody (ASLO) levels were 1571 IU/ml (laboratory reference value, 0-200 IU/ml). No parasites were observed in the stool examination. After treatment with penicillin G-benzathine intramuscularly for four months (one dose per month), the child was asymptomatic and ASLO levels progressively decreased to normal.   "
"A 13-year-old boy with no personal history of interest. His relevant family history included a brother who had died of Wilms' tumour. He consulted for micturition symptoms (dysuria, pollakiuria) with no other symptoms. The urine dipstick was negative. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started until the urine culture result was reported as sterile. In the absence of improvement after one week, the patient visited the emergency department. The anamnesis was associated with micturition symptoms and anuria of 18 hours' duration, together with abdominal pain located in the hypogastrium and right iliac fossa. There was no history of surgery or fever since the onset of the symptoms. On examination, she was in good general condition with no signs of dehydration, and her vitals were within normal values. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. On abdominal examination, palpation was painful in the hypogastrium and right iliac fossa, with local signs of peritoneal irritation. There was no bladder balloon. The rest of the examination showed no relevant findings. Laboratory tests showed no findings of interest: leukocytes 5400 μl, neutrophils 2370 μl (44%), haemoglobin 13.9 mg/dl, C-reactive protein <2.9 mg/l. An abdominal X-ray was performed, which showed no abnormalities, and an abdominal ultrasound with no findings in the urinary tract, with a virtually empty bladder. However, an 8 mm thickened appendix with periappendicular free fluid and thickening of the adjacent fat was visualised; findings compatible with acute appendicitis.  Intravenous fluid infusion was performed in an expansion regime, obtaining adequate diuresis in a short time. Given the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, he underwent surgery under general anaesthesia, identifying phlegmonous appendicitis and performing an appendectomy. The subsequent evolution was favourable, with no postoperative complications.   "
"A ten-year-old boy, with no personal history of interest, presented to the emergency department of the primary care centre with abdominal pain lasting four hours, fever of 40°C, vomiting of food and diarrhoea with traces of mucus. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain, slightly more in the right iliac fossa, with signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed 12,200 leukocytes/µl (91% neutrophils) and slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The patient was referred to the nearest hospital with the suspicion of an acute abdomen for further investigation. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing a tubular image, aperistaltic and incompressible with the transducer, compatible with acute appendicitis. It was decided to perform surgery, after receiving informed consent from the parents, and an appendectomy was performed, during which a cecal appendix with mild inflammatory signs was observed. The postoperative course was torpid, with persistent fever (38.8°C), generalised abdominal pain without peritonism, vomiting and diarrhoea. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed dilatation of the small bowel loops, suggesting incomplete obstruction. The CBC continues to show leukocytosis with left shift and elevated C-reactive protein. Given the incongruence of the patient's symptoms and the operative findings, it was decided to opt for conservative treatment, a stool culture was performed and empirical antibiotherapy was started while awaiting the results of the stool culture, which showed Campylobacter jejuni sensitive to gentamicin. Antibiotic treatment with gentamicin was started, with which the patient's evolution was satisfactory, as the clinical picture resolved and the patient was discharged ten days after surgery. The anatomopathological study of the cecal appendix was reported as cecal appendix with inflammatory signs.   "
"Seven-year-old boy who came to the emergency department with pain in the right hip, limping and fever. The symptoms had started abruptly seven days earlier. On the second day of illness he was assessed in the Traumatology Department and diagnosed with ""hip synovitis"", and prescribed rest and analgesics. The mother reported that during the following days the pain persisted at rest, woke him up at night and improved, but did not disappear, with analgesia. She presented at all times with antalgic postures, functional impotence and lameness. Fever persisted for seven days (maximum 38.5°C), accompanied by decreased appetite. In the last few days, two skin lesions appeared, one on the buttock and the other on the scalp. On general inspection, we found a child in a wheelchair in fair general condition, pale and in an antalgic position with complete flexion of the right hip and knee. During the physical examination, the absence of swelling, pain or limitation at any joint level was surprising, and no bony tender points were found. Active mobilisation of the hip was reduced, while passive mobilisation was normal. The gait was very cautious, and in the standing position he did not bear weight on the right leg. Pediculosis infestation and a nodular, inflamed lesion, both on the scalp, were also observed. Blood tests showed mild neutrophilia and increased acute phase reactants: fibrinogen 1008 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 173 mg/l and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 100 mm/hour. Ultrasound of the hip and abdominopelvic X-ray were normal, except for an antalgic position in the latter.  During his stay in the ED, and after administering intravenous analgesia, abdominal pain appeared progressively on deep palpation in the hypogastrium and right iliac fossa without defence or other signs of peritoneal irritation. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which was normal, and acute surgical pathology was ruled out. The study for fever without focus was completed with a chest X-ray and a urine test strip, which were negative, and it was decided to admit the patient to the Infectious Diseases Unit. The Paediatric Rheumatology Service was consulted and recommended a bone scan, which was carried out in the following days, with negative results. He was admitted with treatment with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Given the normality of the tests performed and the clinical suspicion of psoas abscess, an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was requested, which showed an abscess in the right psoas muscle and osteomyelitis of the L4 vertebral body. The blood culture was sterile, but the puncture of the scalp abscess isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, so antibiotherapy was modified to cover this germ, with meropenem and linezolid. The patient evolved favourably, without the need for surgical drainage.   "
"A seven-year-old boy came to the paediatric primary care clinic 30 minutes before and while walking, presenting with a sensation of palpitations of sudden onset, without accompanying chest pain or dyspnoea. He had not exercised previously. No personal history of heart disease, nor family history of heart disease or sudden death. On arrival at the health centre, the patient was conscious and oriented, with no signs of respiratory distress. Cardiac auscultation shows rhythmic tones at 170-180 beats per minute (bpm), with no murmurs. Peripheral pulses are rhythmic and symmetrical. Good capillary refill. Blood pressure (BP) systolic: 90 mmHg, 31st percentile (P31), diastolic: 65 mmHg (P76). An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed. Fig. 2 shows the measurement of the width of the QRS complex.  Given the electrocardiographic findings of wide QRS tachycardia without haemodynamic repercussions, the paediatrician started an amiodarone infusion (5 mg/kg, intravenous [IV]), and referred the patient to hospital by medical transport. On arrival at the paediatric emergency department, the patient was asymptomatic except for the sensation of palpitations. Physical examination was as follows: weight 22.5 kg (P21), height 119.5 cm (P14), systolic BP 88 mmHg (P25) and diastolic 63 (P71). Conscious and oriented. Good perfusion. Cardiac auscultation with tachycardia without murmurs. Normal peripheral pulses. Rest normal. After analysis of the ECG, the possibility of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) conducted with aberrancy was considered, so it was decided to try to reverse the tachycardia with vagal manoeuvres (gag reflex, cold in the face), without success, so a bolus of adenosine was administered at 0.1 mg/kg IV leaving in sinus rhythm. A baseline ECG was performed, which showed no abnormalities. Blood tests showed ions and myocardial enzymes within the normal range.  The patient was admitted for 24 hours for observation, with no new episodes, an echocardiogram was performed, which was normal, and he was discharged with subsequent follow-up in Cardiology consultations, with a diagnosis of paroxysmal SVT with aberrant conduction.   "
"We present a six-year-old girl who consulted the health centre for right-sided gonalgia with no inflammatory signs or history of trauma. She was treated with ibuprofen and three months later returned to the clinic with pain and inflammation of the fifth metatarsal of the right foot, of a progressive nature, which limited her ambulation. Subsequently, pain and swelling appeared on the dorsum of the right hand. None of the symptoms were accompanied by previous influenza, gastrointestinal infection or urinary symptoms, and she was afebrile at all times. One week later, she visited the clinic for persistent symptoms and functional impotence to stand upright. Her personal and family history and pregnancy were of no clinical interest. Her psychomotor development was normal. The patient's weight was 23.5 kg, height 122 cm, heart rate 74 bpm and general condition was acceptable. Examination revealed right knee with pain, swelling and limited flexion mobility due to pain at 90°, patellar balling and mild swelling with pain in the fifth metacarpophalangeal joint of the right hand, and right foot with increased sensitivity to pressure at the base of the fifth metatarsal and local swelling with pain, without deformity or crepitus. No vasculonervous deficit. The physical examination was normal, with no rash, lymphadenopathy or visceromegaly. X-rays were normal at all times. Laboratory tests: mild thrombocytosis (425 000/µl), no leukocytosis or neutrophilia, C-reactive protein 13 mg/ml, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 52, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive at 1/160, rheumatoid factor negative, anti-DNA negative. Arthrocentesis was performed (biochemistry and culture) obtaining inflammatory fluid with 5360 cells/ml, glucose 69 mg/dl, protein 5.4 g/dl and negative culture. Treatment was started with ibuprofen at a dose of 200 mg every eight hours, pending assessment by the specialist, with a slight improvement. Paediatric Rheumatology requested an assessment, which extended the blood tests, performed an ophthalmological study and started treatment with deflazacort. The extended laboratory tests were negative for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, ENA, HLA B27 and hepatitis B and C serology. Thyroid, urinalysis and coagulation tests were also normal. One month later, she was reviewed by Paediatric Rheumatology and was diagnosed with right knee arthritis ANA(+) and probable JIA, due to persistent swelling and pain in the right knee and tarsus. The study was completed with foot ultrasound and corticosteroid infiltration. The ultrasound was normal and the patient progressed well after the infiltration.   "
"Five-year-old boy referred by his primary care paediatrician for a study due to a right frontoparietotemporal cranial deformity that had become more evident in recent months. He had presented occasional vomiting with bad smells, of one year's evolution, and headache accompanied by sonophobia and phonophobia, of variable frequency and mild intensity that had never woken him up at night since he was three and a half years old. The neurological examination was normal (including fundus examination), except for macrocephaly with a head circumference of 55 cm (>99th percentile). The only significant family history is a left frontal kyphoplasty in the paternal grandfather. Born of a controlled pregnancy, with normal prenatal ultrasound and uncomplicated euthecological delivery. He had no other personal history of interest. Psychomotor development was normal, with free walking at 13 months, language and sociability appropriate for his age, and he attended school with learning difficulties in reading and writing. Cranial CT scan showed a large AQ in the right middle cranial fossa with midline displacement and collapse of the adjacent ventricular loops, which was confirmed by cranial MRI showing hypointense content in the right frontoparietotemporal region in T1 sequences and hyperintense in T2, which did not change after gadolinium contrast.  The patient was referred to neurosurgery, where intracranial pressures were monitored with a pneumatic epidural sensor, using a precoronal frontal trephine, and only the nocturnal pressures were found to be pathological. In view of chronic intracranial hypertension, treatment was decided with cystocysternostomy, communicating the QA with the optico-carotid cistern, by means of a 30° angled endoscope and a catheter with a double ventriculostomy balloon, to favour the communication of the spaces and free circulation of the CSF.   "
"We present the case of a seven-year-old girl who came to the emergency department for right palpebral ptosis and periorbital pain of 24 hours' duration, which did not subside with the usual analgesics, being afebrile, with sporadic nausea and vomiting and without intercurrent infectious process. The patient had no personal or family history of interest, except for an episode similar to the one described in the previous two years, lasting two weeks, which subsided spontaneously without medication. Physical examination revealed paralysis of the supraduction and adduction of the gaze of the right eye, with eyelid ptosis, without pupillary involvement or alteration of other cranial nerves. A complete blood count and general biochemistry, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, glycosylated haemoglobin, anti-DNA antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nucleus antibodies (ENA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and cranial magnetic resonance imaging were performed, all results being normal. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome was diagnosed and oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for five days was prescribed. Within 48 hours, the patient was re-evaluated and presented complete resolution of ophthalmoplegia and pain, with persistence of mild palpebral ptosis, which was maintained for the next six months.   "
"A four-year-old boy who, suddenly, ten days ago, presented with a speech disturbance consisting of repetition of syllables and prolongation of sounds. He has no other neurological symptoms. The parents relate it to a head injury suffered the day before the onset of the symptoms. Previously, his language was slow and considered normal for his age. He showed adequate acquisition of language skills and other neurodevelopmental milestones up to the present. On examination, the patient showed coherent speech with repetition of phonemes in sentences and prolonged pauses between phrases. Pronunciation is correct but the patient has to make an effort to control it. He organises sentences of three or four words without syntactic problems. He shows adequate oral comprehension. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. Given these data, a diagnosis of developmental stuttering is made and assessment by a speech therapist is recommended.   "
"A nine-month-old boy consulted for intense perianal erythema. An initial rectal smear was performed with a negative result of the rapid streptococcal antigen detection test after 24 hours, so treatment was started with clotrimazole. As the patient did not progress well, it was decided to repeat the rectal and pharyngotonsillar smear, finding a positive result for rapid detection of streptococcal antigen in the rectal sample and negative in the pharyngotonsillar sample. Culture of the rectal specimen was negative for fungi and showed growth of GABHS. Treatment with oral penicillin was started for 10 days, with resolution of the picture.  "
"Five-year-old boy presenting with perianal erythema accompanied by anal pain on defecation, afebrile. An anal and pharyngeal swab was taken and a rapid streptococcus test was performed, which was positive in the anal swab, with GABHS growing in the rectal culture. Treatment was started with oral penicillin. Twenty days later she returned because, despite initially improving, the erythema reappeared with less intensity, accompanied by constipation and fissures on examination. Topical mupirocin was prescribed with partial improvement of the symptoms after four days, and topical clotrimazole was added due to suspicion of fungal superinfection, with final resolution of the symptoms.  "
"Eight year old boy referred from the ophthalmology department for right periorbital and palpebral pruritic vesicular-coscoscosal lesions, diagnosed with palpebral herpes zoster that did not improve with topical acyclovir and tobramycin eye drops. For this reason, the antiviral was replaced by its oral presentation, without improvement in six days, and he then decided to withdraw the acyclovir and consult Dermatology, where topical zinc sulphate and sertaconazole were prescribed after taking a skin culture, labelling the periorbital lesion as tinea faciei and adding a topical corticoid to mitigate the hyperkeratotic and desquamative component.  Three weeks later, the patient came in for a check-up, where a slight decrease in pruritus was observed, with stagnation of the previous lesions, while still maintaining a large scaling and keratosis with a poorly defined erythematous-vesicular base. The culture was positive for Candida krusei, so previous therapies were withdrawn, recommending oral griseofulvin in two daily doses with fatty foods and suspending topical corticosteroids, leading to an improvement in the condition with disappearance of cutaneous signs in the following 14 days.   "
"Seven-year-old girl who attended the emergency department in springtime for an episode of complex generalised seizure with disconnection from the environment and falling to the ground while walking, together with hypertonia, sialorrhoea and movements of the corner of the mouth lasting about three minutes, with spontaneous recovery. In the previous days the child had presented with myalgia, headache and fever up to 39°C, but had been afebrile for 24 hours. She had no relevant physiological history: pregnancy, childbirth and perinatal period were of no interest, nor did she have any pathological history of interest, and her only family history was her mother's treatment with lithium for bipolar disorder that had been going on for years. On arrival at the ED, the patient presented a post-critical state with a Glasgow Glasgow score of 10, but the rest of the examination, both neurological and by systems, was normal. The blood tests were outstanding in the biochemistry and haemogram: - Biochemistry: - Glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT): 93 UI/l. - Glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT): 44 IU/l. - C-reactive protein (CRP): 2 mg/l. - Haemogram: - Leukocytes activated aspect: 6000 (N: 30% L: 66% M: 4%). - Platelets 125 000. - Normal red blood count. In view of the afebrile seizure, it was decided to admit him to complete the study. Two hours after admission, he had a new seizure that ceased with the administration of intravenous midazolam at 0.15 mg/kg, but he suffered respiratory arrest requiring T-piece ventilation and was admitted to intensive care for close monitoring and surveillance. On arrival at the intensive care unit, he presented post-critical state, with a Glasgow Glasgow of 7 and all other vital signs normal except for an axillary temperature of 38°C in this case. Neurological examination revealed marked hyperreflexia of the lower limbs, with negative meningeal signs. Urgent cranial computed tomography (CT), lumbar puncture, urine toxicity and lithemia (due to maternal history) were performed, with normal results. An urgent electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, reporting global slowing of activity compatible with meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serology was obtained for enterovirus and herpes virus, both negative. Serology was also obtained for multiple agents such as toxoplasma, rubella, lupus, herpes simplex 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, Mycoplasma, adenovirus, mumps, parvovirus, measles, Coxsackie, ECHO virus and Borrelia, also negative. In the following hours after admission, the patient presented episodes of agitation with somnolence and again presented two generalised convulsive episodes, so maintenance levetiracetam was started at 40 mg/kg/day, with a previous bolus of 20 mg/kg, together with prophylactic acyclovir at 60 mg/kg/day, despite the negative serology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested urgently, with normal results and no evidence of bleeding or hyperdensity lesions. Given the history of myalgia and fever in the previous days and the poor recovery of the neurological symptoms, it was decided to determine influenza A antigens in the nasal exudate, which was positive, so treatment was started with oseltamivir 5 mg/kg/day for a total of five days, and acyclovir was discontinued. The patient progressively improved, but suffered a new convulsive episode and it was decided to extend serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes and influenza A negative, and a repeat MRI of the brain was performed, which remained normal. CSF oligoclonal bands were requested, which were negative, and the autoimmunity study with anti-DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-histone, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SCL70, anti-Jo, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative. Valproic acid was administered at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day, with complete cessation of seizures. The patient had a total of five seizure episodes and on discharge the EEG improved, although not completely normal. Treatment was continued with valproic acid 40 mg/kg/day and levetiracepam 60 mg/kg/day. Currently, the patient continues to be monitored at Neuropaediatrics consultations, now without anti-comedic medication, and remains asymptomatic, with normal EEG at the last visit.   "
"Three and a half year old boy with severe neurological damage secondary to perinatal ischaemic acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He came to the clinic with his mother, who reported unusual crying for some weeks and the suspicion that the child had pain in his hands. She also told us that the child had been receiving treatment with oral steroids for some weeks, as during the follow-up of his neurological damage, when consulting for locomotor system symptoms, chronic idiopathic arthritis was suspected, with normal X-rays of the hands and wrists. He is an only child of non-consanguineous parents. The father has had a bone problem in his wrists since childhood; he recalls having suffered pain in his wrists as a child and tells us that he has no wrist bones, that he retains normal mobility and that this does not cause him any problems in his profession as a car driver. The physical examination of the child is conditioned by his neurological damage (he shouts, without any other type of language and listens and attends when spoken to, smiling when caressed); he is not capable of ambulation without assistance; a left hemiplegia derived from his perinatal stroke and the typical signs of spasticity. Somatometry shows a head circumference of 46 cm (< P3), a length of 104 cm (P25-50) and a weight of 16.5 kg (P50). Blood pressure values are normal (111/66 mmHg). There are no dysmorphic features. The child's repeated attempts to bite his right wrist are striking. There are no inflammatory signs and the child expresses himself with groans on repeated mobilisation of the right wrist. No other joints were found to be affected. The father is 180 cm tall, but his wingspan is reduced to 164 cm. His hand is 18.7 cm long (shortened by 4 cm for his height) with a third finger of 8.3 cm (normal). The paternal radiograph shows bilateral absence of the carpus.  The child's X-ray shows carpal lesions compatible with carpal osteolysis and unilateral tarsal scaphoid lesions.  The genetics service was consulted and the diagnosis of multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis of autosomal dominant transmission without nephropathy was studied and confirmed.   "
"Previously healthy child. His only history is that he was operated on for left cryptorchidism; he is correctly vaccinated for his age. When he was five years old, he presented for the first time with bilateral parotid inflammation (with erythema, swelling and pain), accompanied by fever, which was managed on an outpatient basis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and oral anti-inflammatory drugs. He had a second episode, also managed on an outpatient basis. The third episode required hospital admission due to poor clinical evolution and general malaise after starting treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Physical examination revealed a bilateral laterocervical tumour (initially on the right) that obliterated the mandibular angle, with no signs of fluctuation or secretion or inflammatory signs of Stenon's duct. Blood tests showed a significant leukocytosis (24 100/mm3) with neutrophilia (78.7%), C-reactive protein (CRP) of 4.11 mg/dl and elevated α-amylase (up to 1451 U/l). During admission, an ultrasound scan showed enlarged parotid glands with increased density, heterogeneous and hypoechoic foci. The patient was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for two days intravenously, followed by eight days of oral treatment, analgesia and anti-inflammatory drugs, with good subsequent evolution. The Paediatric Infectious Diseases Department followed up the patient, from where the study was completed. An immunity study was performed, which was normal, rheumatoid tests were negative, and a serological study was negative, except for the mumps vaccination serology, which was positive. She has not presented any new episodes for more than a year.   "
"Four-year-old female patient, born in Mali and adopted at six months of age, with no significant pathological history and correct immunisations. She consulted for the appearance of papular skin lesions and crusted nummular plaques with a tendency to coalesce on the anterior aspect of the right thigh. Topical fusidic acid was initially prescribed, without clinical improvement and with the appearance of similar lesions on the trunk, the root of the extremities and the face. There was no palmoplantar or mucosal involvement. The lesions were not pruritic.  On reinterrogation and re-exploration of the patient, there was an isolated lesion on the dorsum of the right foot, oval in shape, hyperpigmented with perimarginal scaly collarette, which had preceded the rest of the lesions and which was classified as a herald plaque. The final diagnosis was Gibert's pink pityrasis in a black patient, and symptomatic treatment was started with a good evolution.   "
"A one-and-a-half-month-old girl presented with fever (38°C) of 48 hours' evolution and irritability, associated nasal mucus; on examination she had a small erythematous rash and the rest of the examination was normal. Initial CBC: leukocytes 6310/µl (67% segmented, 6% lancets, 19% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes), haemoglobin (Hb) 10.9 g/dl, haematocrit (Hto) 29.6%, platelets 492 000/µl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 8.9 mg/l. Lumbar puncture: glucose 51.3 mg/dl, protein 133.9 mg/dl (haemorrhagic fluid). Given the suspicion of severe bacterial infection, she was admitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment with cefotaxime and ampicillin (200 mg/kg/day), adding acyclovir (60 mg/kg/day) in the following 24 hours to cover the herpes simplex virus. Febrile after 48 hours. On the fourth day he presented irritability, poor colour and general condition, with persistent evanescent rash, and respiratory distress; a control blood test was performed with the following findings: leukocytes 2670/µl (segmented 31%, keys 3%, lymphocytes 47%, atypical lymphocytes 5%, monocytes 11%), reticulocytes 0.66%, Hb 8.0 g/dl, Ht 25.3%, platelets 131 000/µl. Capillary blood gases: pH 7.32, PCO2 43.3 and HCO3 21.8 mmol/l. Chest X-ray: bilateral alveolar interstitial infiltrates, more striking on the left side, suggestive of acute pulmonary oedema. Given the finding of pancytopenia, samples were taken for parvovirus and enterovirus serology, as well as influenza A serology. High-flow oxygen therapy was started and he was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital, where he remained for five days.  Immunoglobluin M (IgM) antibodies for parvovirus B19 were positive and IgG negative, leading to a diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection, respiratory failure and associated pancytopenia. The patient showed progressive improvement on the fifth day of admission, and was discharged on the twelfth day without further complications. The girl's brother subsequently presented with fifth-day erythema infectiosum.   "
"An 11-year-old girl presented with asthenia, weight loss and fever of 13 days' duration, with fever peaks every day, with no fixed time pattern. Examination revealed an asthenic habitus (weight P3-10) and thick, whitish mucus in the cavum, with the rest of the examination being normal. Laboratory tests on admission: leukocytes 4060/µl (segmented 59%, white blood cells 6%, lymphocytes 33%, monocytes 2%), Hb 13.3 g/dl, Ht 38%, platelets 25 000/µl. Smear showed red blood cells, activated lymphocytes and neutrophil vacuolisation; CRP 58.1 mg/l (88.2 mg/l, at an ED visit two days earlier); proteinuria in the urine sediment. He was admitted with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment due to smear findings and elevated acute phase reactants. She remained afebrile from the second day of admission. During her admission she presented micropetechiae in the lower limbs and dorsum of the feet on the second day, as well as oral mucosal bleeding on the third day; in view of these findings and the fact that on the fourth day she presented a blood test of 8000 platelets/µl, it was decided to administer a dose of gamma globulin, with an adequate response to treatment, presenting clinical improvement and an increase in platelet count to 16,000/µl.  The patient was diagnosed with a long-standing fever with no fever, positive IgM parvovirus B19, and a diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection, secondary plateletopenia and mild proteinuria, with the rest of the renal function remaining normal.   "
"We present the case of a three-month-old infant with a history of refusal of feedings, nausea, regurgitation and vomiting of one month's evolution. For this reason he was referred from Primary Care to the Emergency Department. He was a full-term newborn of appropriate weight for gestational age, with a normal pregnancy course in which no polyhydramnios was observed. The neonatal period was uneventful, with adequate psychomotor and weight and weight-related development until two months of age, when he began to show the symptoms described above. On arrival at the emergency department, he appeared to be in poor general condition, with dry mucous membranes, haggard, capillary refill greater than 2 seconds and skin pallor, with the rest of the physical examination being normal. Vital signs were: temperature, 36.6°C; heart rate, 137 bpm; blood pressure, 88/55 mmHg (p75); O2 saturation, 100%; respiratory rate, 52 rpm; blood glucose, 90 mg/dl. Weight 5.995 kg (P10), height 60.5 cm (P10). He was expanded with physiological saline solution and blood tests were performed, with a normal haemogram and biochemistry showing: Na 151 mEq/l; K 2.2 mEq/l; Cl 130 mEq/l and in the venous blood gas analysis: pH 7.29, pCO2 27 mmHg, bicarbonate 13 mmol/l and ionic calcium 1.74 mg/dl. Findings compatible with metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap. A urine dipstick was performed on urine from one urination with pH 7, density 1015 and negative remainder. The patient required intravenous serum therapy with maximum potassium (80 mEq/l) and bicarbonate (3 mEq/kg/day), and was discharged after a week, maintaining oral treatment with sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate. Renal ultrasound showed bilateral papillary hyperechogenicity, compatible with the onset of nephrocalcinosis. Ophthalmological assessment, bone series and auditory potentials were normal. During follow-up until nine months of age, the patient was asymptomatic, with improvement in weight-for-nature development (p25 for weight and p50 for height), and treatment doses were adjusted according to the change in weight. The blood tests six months after discharge are shown in Table 2. In the control ultrasound performed six months after discharge, the findings compatible with nephrocalcinosis persisted.   "
"Eight-year-old boy with diffuse intermittent abdominal complaints in recent years, attributed to acute banal processes. No personal or family history of interest. No urinary infections or other urinary symptoms. Coinciding with an episode of abdominal pain in the right hemiabdomen, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, which revealed mesenteric adenitis and mild dilatation of the right renal pelvis, with suspected stenosis of the UPU. Urine sediment and urine culture were normal.  The abdominal pain disappeared spontaneously, but the patient was referred to Paediatric Nephrology for follow-up. In the control ultrasound, while asymptomatic, dilatation of the urinary tract with mild-moderate dilatation of the right renal pelvis was still visible, so an isotopic renogram was requested (suspicion of pyeloureteral junction stenosis). The renogram confirmed obstructive ectasia in the right kidney. The renal scintigraphy study showed an increase in right renal size, with evident hypocaptation along the medial border, signs of dilatation of the tract, with a renal function of 58.8% in the left kidney and 41.2% in the right kidney. Given the dilatation of the urinary tract due to obstructive causes, the patient was referred to paediatric urology for surgery. A nephrostomy catheter was placed for a few months to recover and prevent deterioration of renal function5,6. After removal of the nephrostomy catheter, imaging, clinical and analytical controls continued to be carried out, with progressive normalisation.   "
"Male infant aged one month, with no personal history of interest, who came to the emergency department for the third time in the last week with a partially consolable crying episode. He had been diagnosed with infant colic and the usual measures were recommended. He is exclusively breastfed. In the last 48 hours his feeding has been worse, his crying, which was initially in the evening, has continued all day and the mother has not been able to calm him in her arms since yesterday. He remains afebrile and in excellent general condition, with adequate weight gain, currently weighing 4 kg. Physical examination reveals abdominal distension and palpation of a periumbilical mass extending to the right flank, with no obvious defence. She frankly refused breastfeeding in the emergency department and presented with vomiting of food. With suspicion of intestinal obstruction, an abdominal X-ray showed marked abdominal silence (absence of gas) in the right hemiabdomen and a mass effect with displacement of the intestinal loops towards the left hemiabdomen. The ultrasound scan showed a central abdominal image measuring approximately 9 x 8.7 x 7.9 cm, which appeared as a large space-occupying focal lesion with cystic characteristics and no vascular flow on colour Doppler and multiloculated and multitabulated.  The patient was transferred to a reference centre for paediatric surgery. The study was completed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, which revealed a voluminous intra-abdominal cystic mass measuring 90 x 60 x 65 mm, located mainly in the right flank and the central abdominal region. It extends from the lower edge of the liver, in front of the right kidney, displacing the intestinal structures to the left. It is a multilocular mass with well-defined borders and thin walls, with multiple cystic components of different sizes. The first suspected diagnosis was cystic lymphangioma of the mesentery.  The patient underwent mid laparotomy and a multicystic mass containing whitish liquid was excised from the mesentery of a loop of the middle ileum. The loop was resected and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The postoperative period, the first 24 hours in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and the rest on the ward, was uneventful and in eight days the patient was sent home with adequate enteral tolerance and no complications. The pathological anatomy confirms the diagnosis of mesenteric cystic lymphagioma with a multiseptate cystic mass of approximately 5 cm in diameter with a smooth whitish wall and a thickness of 0.1 cm.   "
"A girl aged three years and ten months was seen for recurrent episodes of muscle weakness in the lower limbs, which recovered spontaneously within minutes. Personal history of no interest. Controlled pregnancy without incident; vaginal birth. Artificial lactation. Normal perinatal and psychomotor development. No muscle weakness or cramps reported up to six months previously. Family history included hyperkalemic paralysis in several relatives on the paternal side (father, paternal uncle and aunt, paternal grandmother) without providing further details and without being able to specify the genetic study. The clinical picture began about six months before coming to the clinic, being previously asymptomatic; they reported 3-4 intermittent episodes, on separate days, of muscle cramps and a feeling of numbness in the lower limbs while sleeping, from which she recovered spontaneously in a few minutes. She showed no other clinical manifestations or involvement of other limbs. Since these episodes the patient remained asymptomatic. Clinical and neurological examination was normal at the time of examination, with normal strength, sensitivity and osteotendinous reflexes. In view of the suspicion of familial hyperkalemic paralysis, an analytical study was requested with a haemogram and biochemistry, which were normal. Blood count was normal, electrolytes in blood and urine normal, K 4.5 mEq/l with fractional potassium excretion (FEK) of 13%. It was not possible to perform blood tests coinciding with the clinical presentation. Electromyography (EMG), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and electrocardiogram (ECG) could not be performed at the same time as the clinical examination, as the patient had no new symptoms. The electromyography (EMG), without coinciding with the clinical picture, was normal. In view of the clinical suspicion, given the family history, despite the fact that the clinical manifestations were not very evident, a genetic study of the SCN4A gene (OMIM +603967) was requested, detecting a heterozygous p.Thr704Met mutation. At the time of diagnosis, treatment with oral acetazolamide was not started as the episodes of muscle weakness have not recurred and serum potassium values were normal in the controls performed. Periodic clinical and analytical controls will be carried out to assess whether, at some point, medical treatment is required. A diet not rich in potassium was prescribed.   "
"Eight-year-old girl, of Bolivian origin, consulted our health centre for intermittent vaginal bleeding and mucopurulent, foul-smelling vaginal discharge for the last two months. Physical examination revealed severe congestion and oedema of the hymen and vulvar introitus. The girl lives with her parents and a paternal uncle and his partner at the same address and they deny any evidence of sexual abuse. Given this florid clinical picture, she was referred to the emergency department for differential diagnosis of vaginal foreign body and to rule out sexual abuse. A gynaecological examination was performed, where a vaginal foreign body was ruled out and a vaginal exudate sample was collected. In turn, she was assessed by the on-call forensic doctor, who issued a judicial report ruling out signs of sexual abuse. The culture of the vaginal exudate was positive for Shigella sonnei resistant according to the antibiogram to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin and the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and sensitive to cefuroxime axetil, cefixime and gentamicin. A stool culture, perianal exudate culture and urine culture were also requested and were negative. It was decided to prescribe antibiotic treatment with cefuroxime axetil for ten days, showing great clinical improvement, but without complete resolution of the symptoms, so the same treatment regimen was repeated, with the clinical symptoms disappearing.  "
"Six-month-old female infant. Controlled pregnancy of normal course and no family history of interest. Programmed caesarean delivery due to breech presentation. Artificial lactation without incident. Correct vaccination schedule. Beginning of complementary feeding at five months of age (fruit and gluten-free cereals). Her parents consult because they have noticed, since the introduction of fruit porridge, the appearance of erythema on both temples a few minutes after starting to eat. They report that the symptoms are reproduced with any type of fruit intake and that the erythema increases in intensity as the amount of fruit ingested increases. The child does not refuse fruit and even eats it with a certain avidity. The erythema usually disappears after about ten minutes and is not accompanied by any other symptoms. As the patient was asymptomatic at the time of the examination, it was decided to carry out a controlled provocation test in the consulting room. A few seconds after starting to eat, erythematous, faint red plaques with poorly defined limits suddenly appeared on the bilateral temporal region, being more evident on the right side.  Based on the anamnesis, physical examination and provocation test, Frey's syndrome was suspected and the parents were informed of its benign and self-limiting nature. An expectant attitude was maintained, with no need for complementary tests or treatment, and the usual complementary feeding regime was maintained. After a month, the clinical symptoms subside, although the erythema reappears after 12 months with the consumption of natural yoghurt, which is also acidic, and disappears definitively after several weeks.  "
"We present the case of a three year old girl who came to the primary care clinic for three days presenting with toothache and discrete dental phlegmon, without fever.  The examination revealed a caries in the lower right second molar, with discrete inflammation and mandibular pain. It was decided to start antibiotic treatment with high-dose amoxicillin and anti-inflammatory drugs, and the patient was referred to the dentist3. The patient was seen at the dentist's office four days later. The phlegmon and regional adenopathy persisted, but there was no pain. It was decided to continue with treatment and monitoring. After a week of treatment, the phlegmon was more defined and painful, and the patient was referred to maxillofacial surgery. That same afternoon he presented with fever and was referred to the Emergency Department, where it was decided to treat with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and to see a dentist. Twenty days later, at the primary care clinic, he presented with a red, painful and suppurative abscess on the right submaxillary border. She was again referred to the emergency department for drainage. There it was drained and samples were taken for culture and pathological anatomy of the ulcerated cervical lesion. Treatment was started with azithromycin and ciprofloxacin.  The result of the pathological anatomy describes granulation tissue with acute and chronic inflammation and central necrosis, with no microorganisms observed (with Grocot, Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen techniques) and no traces of lymph node are identified. The evolution of the ulcer was torpid, with treatment every two days at the health centre. One month after drainage, exodontia was performed, with definitive improvement after two months of evolution. The large scar on the face begins to involute.   "
"Infant aged three and a half months, of Maghrebi origin, correctly vaccinated for his age, with no medical history of interest. Pregnancy controlled in Spain, gestational period passed without incident. Family history: healthy, non-consanguineous parents; two sisters aged three and ten years, healthy, and five brothers who died before the age of one year, all of whom died of a complicated respiratory condition. The infant had adequate weight gain and no infections since birth. He was referred to his referral hospital because of a family history of male infants who had died prematurely. A blood test was performed at our centre that showed decreased absolute and subclass immunoglobulin levels: IgG 153 mg/dl, IgA 23 mg/dl, IgM 17 mg/dl and IgE 10.8 mg/dl. Flow cytometry for the study of lymphocyte subpopulations showed a percentage and absolute decrease in B lymphocytes (1.5%, 109/µL), with a relative predominance of T lymphocytes, confirming the diagnosis of humoral immunodeficiency, suspected Bruton's disease, which was confirmed by genetic study. Treatment was started with monthly intravenous gamma globulin (400 mg/kg) and complete vaccination (including pneumococcal), with satisfactory evolution. She is currently six years old, undergoing replacement treatment with monthly gamma globulin and has not presented any complications or intercurrent processes, presenting a good staturoponder curve.  "
"A 13-year-old girl, with no past history of interest, came to the clinic with severe vomiting and abdominal pain of five days' duration. She was in fair general condition, with no signs of dehydration, with diffuse abdominal pain and no other accompanying symptoms. During his stay, after vomiting, he suddenly presented with chest pain and crackles in the neck. He was referred to the emergency department for evaluation. Chest X-ray showed signs of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and upper chest region. Serum therapy and intravenous antiemetics were prescribed, and the vomiting subsided, so he was discharged without requiring hospitalisation. In a subsequent check-up five days later, the condition resolved without complications.   "
"A one and a half month old girl is referred to the paediatric clinic for a right pelvic kidney and a white tuft of hair in the frontal region.  She is from the first pregnancy of a healthy mother. The pregnancy was controlled without incident, with normal ultrasound scans except for the right pelvic kidney. Vaginal delivery, instrumented at 38 weeks gestational age. Birth weight 2320 grams, Apgar 10/10. Bilateral correct otoemissions. Family history: white parents, healthy mother aged 25 years, healthy father aged 36 years, except for acromic spots in the middle third of both thighs, without having been diagnosed with any disease. Other family history is unknown. The patient is asymptomatic; her bowel rhythm and diuresis are normal. Physical examination reveals a tuft of white frontal hair and a triangular-shaped acromic macule on the frontal region. There are no other skin lesions. The rest of the examination is normal, with psychomotor development so far normal. Piebaldism is clinically suspected, but additional tests are requested to check for ophthalmological anomalies and deafness, which must be absent to confirm the clinical diagnosis of piebaldism. Ophthalmological assessment ruled out ocular lesions and auditory evoked potentials were performed, which were normal. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a right pelvic kidney with no other abnormalities. An analytical study (blood count and chemistry) was requested, which was normal, and a genetic study for mutation of the KIT gene (OMIM 164920) (4q12), which was negative. A heterozygous variant in the KIT gene of unknown clinical significance [c.2509G>A;(p.Ala837Thr)] was detected (also negative in the father).  "
"Eight-year-old patient with no personal or family history of interest. She came to the emergency department because, coinciding with a catarrhal process with odynophagia without fever, she suddenly presented with coprolalia, selective memory disorder (she did not remember and confused some names of people she knew), anomalous behaviour with hyperactivity and compulsive movements. He does not lose consciousness and there is no alteration of muscle tone or strength. The family describes the picture as an explosive and surprising behavioural alteration. The episode lasts a few minutes and when he arrives at the emergency department he is calmer, although he continues to show language alterations and confusion in relation to his family and the environment in which he finds himself. He reports catarrhal symptoms and a sore throat. He is afebrile. No exanthema was observed on examination; cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. ENT examination: tonsillar exudation. Abdomen: soft, without visceromegaly. Sensitivity, tone, strength and osteotendinous reflexes are normal. There were no signs of neurological focality. Blood tests showed 18 400 leukocytes (86 segmented, three segmented, three white blood cells, six lymphocytes, three monocytes), and 260 000 platelets. Biochemistry with no alterations in the basic screening, C-reactive protein (CRP): 11 mg/l. A throat swab was taken and was positive for Streptococcus pyogenes (group A). She was admitted for observation and study of the process and antibiotic treatment was started with amoxicillin, which ended ten days later. The neuropsychiatric symptoms disappeared completely 24 hours after admission. Given the rapid resolution and the child's good general condition, it was decided to discharge him from hospital and continue with outpatient treatment. When we saw him at the primary care clinic, the patient was asymptomatic, with no alterations in the physical and neurological examination. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram were requested and found to be normal. He was seen for a catarrhal process three months later, with no recurrence of the symptoms described in the previous episode of tonsillitis. He remained without relapses. He has undergone tonsillar exudate tests on two occasions for infectious processes, both of which were negative. Carrier status has also been ruled out, although anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) antibody levels have not been determined as there have been no further clinical relapses.  "
"A four-year-old girl came to the emergency department with a palpable purpuric rash on the lower limbs and buttocks, pain and swelling in the left ankle and on the second finger of the right hand. As a background, the week prior to the onset of the clinical picture she had acute pharyngitis.  Additional tests:  Microbiology: rapid detection of group A β-hemolytic streptococcus negative, sterile urine culture, negative blood culture. Blood count: leukocytes 8320/mm3, haemoglobin 13 g/dl, platelets 276 000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in the first hour of 18 mm/h. Coagulation tests: prothrombin time 13.9 seconds (range 10-14), Quick's index 69% (range 70-150), international normalised ratio (INR) 1.25 (range 0.85-1.15), activated partial thromboplastin time 31.4 seconds (range 26-36), fibrinogen 429 ng/ml (range 200-400). Biochemistry: glucose 82 mg/dl, urea 20 mg/dl, creatinine 0.40 mg/dl, total/direct bilirubin 0.4/0.2 mg/dl, total protein 7.5 g/dl, albumin 3.5 g/dl, total calcium 8.6 mg/dl, GOT/GPT 23/15 IU/l, GGT 15 IU/l, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 254 IU/l, FA 127 IU/l. Ions: Na 130 mEq/l, K 3.5 mEq/l, Cl 103 mEq/l. C-reactive protein 1.05 mg/dl. Urine sediment: no significant proteinuria or haematuria.  Due to the clinical characteristics, the case suggests Schönlein-Henoch purpura with joint involvement as a first possibility. The case evolved satisfactorily with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rest.  "
"A seven-year-old girl born in Spain with no previous pathology was referred to the Paediatric Infectious Diseases Unit for painful left submandibular lymphadenopathy of one month's duration, with no response to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and oral anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient had no fever, night sweats or weight loss. She was not vaccinated with BCG. For one month a year she visits Morocco, where she has contact with animals (sheep, lambs) and consumes unpasteurised dairy products. Physical examination revealed a left submandibular conglomerate of lymphadenopathies, painful on palpation, hard, non-rolling and non-adherent, the largest lymph node measuring 2 × 2 cm. The rest of the physical examination and anamnesis by apparatus showed no pathological findings. Given the lack of response to treatment and taking into account the epidemiological data, a tuberculin test was performed, which was positive, with a 10 mm induration with vesicular pattern at 72 hours. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal.  Brucella, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serologies were negative. CBC showed normal haemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 47 mm/hour and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) (QuantiFERON(r)) was positive with a value of 10.15 (normal range: 0-0.35). A fine needle aspiration puncture (FNA) of the adenopathy showed a thick, whitish material. Culture and cytology revealed a pattern of necrotising granulomatous lymphadenitis. Given the limited involvement of the patient and the suspicion of tuberculous adenitis, initial home treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide was prescribed, pending culture of the sample obtained by FNA. The culture was positive for M. bovis, with an antibiogram showing resistance to pyrazinamide and sensitivity to streptomycin, ethambutol, isoniazid and rifampicin. For this reason, pyrazinamide was replaced by ethambutol for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin until the end of six months. Mycobacterial cultures in gastric juice were negative. During this time, the patient attended regular check-ups at the Paediatric Infectious Diseases Department, which showed a good clinical evolution and complete resolution of the infectious process.  "
"We present the clinical case of a five-year-old boy with atopic dermatitis since the first months of life, with no other personal or family history of interest. As an infectious history, he had suffered chickenpox a year earlier without complications and a lesion compatible with herpes labialis on his father a few days earlier. The patient consulted the emergency department for vesicular, erythematous skin lesions that had been present for two days. Some of the lesions showed signs of impetiginisation without signs of cellulitis. The skin lesions were distributed on both lower and upper limbs and trunk. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Fever of 38°C maximum since twelve hours before. No other symptoms. There was no family history of infection at the time of consultation.  On suspicion of Kaposi's varicelliform rash, it was decided to admit her for the start of intravenous treatment with acyclovir at 20 mg/kg/day. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 50 mg/kg/day and daily treatment with chlorhexidine were added to the treatment. On admission, an analytical study was performed with a haemogram and biochemistry, without elevation of acute phase reactants, and serology was extracted for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, Epstein Barr virus, parvovirus and human herpes virus type 6. The clinical course was favourable, with fever disappearing within 24 hours of admission and no systemic or cutaneous complications. From the third day onwards, the lesions were all in the crusting phase with progressive detachment of the crusted lesions without incident. Discharge was decided on the fourth day of admission, completing oral treatment with acyclovir for a further seven days. One week after admission, the patient showed no signs of skin lesions except for his known atopic dermatitis. The serology result was negative for all the tests except IgM positive for herpes simplex virus type 1.  "
"A girl aged two years and ten months with a history of atopic dermatitis attended the emergency department for skin lesions on the trunk and generalised pruritus of 12 hours' duration. She was afebrile, with no other symptoms. Physical examination revealed erythematous, non-confluent lesions on the trunk, assessed as haematous and evanescent, as well as the presence of tonsillar exudate. The rapid streptococcus test in the pharynx was negative. The patient was diagnosed with acute parainfectious urticaria and pharyngotonsillitis of probable viral aetiology. After 36 hours of evolution, the patient returned due to progressive skin involvement, with pruritic erythematodecamative lesions in the periocular and periorbital regions and in patchy plaques on the trunk and large folds, together with areas of superinfection and scratching lesions on the trunk. The pharyngeal exudate persists, she remains afebrile and complains of pain on picking her up. An outbreak of atopic dermatitis with superinfection was diagnosed and treatment was started with oral deflazacort.  Seventy-two hours later, the patient presented again with worsening of the lesions, associated with fever, malaise and pain on palpation of the skin. The haemogram showed leukocytosis of 17500/mm3 without neutrophilia (neutrophils: 51%, lymphocytes: 34.8%) and C-reactive protein of 4.3 mg/l. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with scalded skin syndrome and was admitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment with clindamycin and cloxacillin. Foments with 2% sodium borate and antibiotic ointment were applied to the palpebral and perioral lesions. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in the conjunctival and pharyngeal exudate and in a skin lesion; the blood culture was sterile. The patient progressed favourably and was discharged six days after admission.   "
"A nine-year-old boy came to the clinic with a circinate erythematous lesion, with raised, erythematous borders, notably more active than the centre of the lesion, measuring about 10 cm, located on the right thigh. Treated with hydration, it disappeared in a few weeks. However, after a few months she presented similar lesions of smaller size scattered on the thorax, neck and thigh.  A culture of the lesions was performed, with negative results. Given the intense pruritus and the spontaneous resolution with hydration, the dermatologist responded that the most likely cause was atopic eczema. He therefore advised treatment with topical corticosteroids.  "
"Mrs. T.P. is a 36-year-old woman who was employed from the age of 25 to 33 as a welder, using styrene, in a plastic tank factory. Approximately one year after starting work, she became pregnant and was on sick leave until the age of 27, as required by law. As the patient was exposed to styrene again for professional reasons, she began to enjoy the subjective effects of volatile solvents, including styrene and acetone. When the patient was 32 years old, the company doctor recommended that she be removed from her job, after urine tests showed elevated levels of styrene metabolites. After a year, the patient decided to leave the factory. However, her addictive behaviours had not only persisted but had extended to alcoholic household detergents, hair sprays and motor fuels. Acute anxiety symptoms first appeared suddenly at work when the patient was 28 years old. Her first panic-like attack included dizziness, trembling, leg weakness and paraesthesias. Acute episodes of anxiety recurred and resulted in frequent absences from work for several days to recover from residual symptoms, such as headache and vertigo. After leaving work she was depressed for a few months and was treated with antidepressant medication. Although she recovered from her affective disorder, the residual anxiety symptoms were complicated by agoraphobia. Finally, the patient developed duodenal ulcer at the age of 35 years. The main chronological relationships between occupational exposure, substance abuse behaviour, anxiety symptoms and life events are shown in Figure 1.  At the time of consultation, the patient was unemployed and separated from her husband, lived with her son in her mother's house, presented with fluctuating anxiety and persistent symptoms of mild depression and, although inhalant abuse was sporadic, the patient reported withdrawal from volatile substances in recent days. The most prominent mental disorders on examination included vertigo, psychic and somatic tension, paraesthesias, weakness in the legs and mild agoraphobia. The patient was dissatisfied with her prescribed antidepressant treatments (i.v. maprotiline, v.o. paroxetine) and was dependent on anxiolytic drugs (mainly alprazolam). Psychiatric and psychological assessment Table I refers to the SCL-90-R scores and indices. Specifically, the patient scored positive on all symptoms listed in the anxiety dimension in the last 7 days, and all but two (palpitations and tremor) obtained maximum scores; in contrast, the patient scored low on chest discomfort (which is an item of the somatization dimension).  We also administered the WAIS and the Rorschach test, since abnormalities in performance on these instruments had been found among workers exposed to medium-low concentrations of styrene (Jégaden et al. 1993, Lindstrom & Martelin 1980). Our patient showed an uneven profile of intellectual abilities on the Wechsler scale, with obviously lower scores on two subtests: arithmetic and number series (mainly on the inverse series); apart from possible organic damage, the loss of ability to concentrate may be due to anxiety. The Rorschach revealed a personality prone to emotional pain, somatisation, insecurity and depressive mood; the ego structure, although fragile, was well preserved; possible organic signs were below the threshold. Overall, psychological assessment was consistent with neuroticism, but did not demonstrate brain damage. Neuroimaging Axial and coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained after injection of medium contrast (gadolinium-DTPA). Previous MRI scans in inhalant abusers showed: a variable degree of brain atrophy, poor differentiation between grey and white matter, increased periventricular signal intensity and moderate hypointensity of the thalamus and basal ganglia on T2-weighted images (Yamanouchi et al. 1995). In our patient, no signs of intraparenchymal intensity alterations or intracranial areas of hypersignal were observed, so it was concluded that there was no brain alteration.  "
"A 64-year-old man with right mandibular swelling of 6 months' duration. The plain X-ray showed a well-demarcated, osteolytic, multiloculated, expansive lesion located in the horizontal mandibular ramus. The computed tomography showed an expansive lesion with destruction of the bone cortex. With the provisional diagnosis of probable ameloblastoma, the lesion was resected and biopsied. By means of an interpapillary incision, the mandible was exposed, showing a bulging surface destroyed by a fleshy tumour of dense consistency surrounding the branch of the inferior dental nerve. After careful curettage of the bone cavity, the mandible was reconstructed and the mucosa was replaced. There were no postoperative complications.  The material sent to the pathological anatomy consisted of tumour fragments of about 2x1.5 cm, greyish-white when cut and of firm consistency. Several samples were taken, fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and processed using routine techniques: 4m thick sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin-eosin. Representative sections were immunohistochemically studied by the avidin-biotin peroxidase method, using primary antibodies anti epithelial membrane antigen EMA, (Dako M613, USA, 10/500), S-100 protein (Dako, L1845, USA, pre-diluted), neurofilaments (Biogenex 6670-0154, USA), NSE neuro-specific enolase, (Biogenex MU055-VC, USA, 10/1000), CD57 (Becton-Dickinson 7660, USA, 10/500), CD34 (Becton-Dickinson 7660, USA, 10/500), smooth muscle a-actin (Dako MO851, USA, 10/200), desmin (Dako M760, USA, 10/500), and vimentin (Shandon 402255, USA, pred. ). The process was performed following the standard protocol, using positive and negative controls. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed on 50m thick paraffin-embedded sections using an LSI BCR/ABL dual colour mixer (VYSIS Inc, Downers Grove, USA) following the manufacturer's recommended procedure and examined with a Nikon fluorescence microscope with a triple band filter, and a hundred nuclei were studied by two of the authors. Histologically, the tumour fragments consisted of elongated cells of regular shape and size arranged in interlacing bundles and in ""onion bulb"" structured whorls. The cell density and intercellular stroma were variable, with some areas showing a myxoid appearance. No palisaded cells or atypical cell pleomorphism or atypical mitoses were observed. Residual fibres of the mandibular nerve trunk were identified at the periphery of some fragments. With the provisional diagnosis of PIN, complementary examinations were performed.  Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumour cells were strongly positive for EMA and vimentin and negative for S-100 protein, NSE, collagen IV, CD57, smooth muscle a-actin, desmin and CD34. Schwann cells in the whorls were positive for S-100 protein and axons positive for anti-neurofilament antigen were identified in the centre of the ""bulbs"". Residual dental nerve fibres were positive for S-100 protein, NSE and neurofilaments and the perineurium positive for EMA.  Fluorescence in situ hybridisation revealed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11) in the nuclei of 75% of tumour cells as well as centromere loss of chromosome 22.   "
"A 46-year-old man, with no relevant pathological history, non-smoker. He underwent a fixed restoration on a single-tooth implant (ITI® SLA. Straumann. Walderburg-Switzerland) placed in the 3.6 zone. Six months after the crown was cemented, he attended a check-up without reporting any associated symptoms. Clinical examination revealed a slight reddening of the mucosa adjacent to the implant and a peri-implant pocket 6 mm deep, with slight bleeding on probing. The articulating paper showed premature contact on the prosthetic crown. The panoramic radiograph showed a radiolucent area in the marginal bone at 3.6. Occlusal grinding of the prosthetic crown was performed. Subsequently, a mucoperiosteal flap was raised from 3.5 to 3.7, revealing a fibrous soft tissue surround occupying a marginal peri-implant bone defect at 3.6. The pathological tissue was removed with plastic curettes and sent for pathological examination. The implant surface was decontaminated with 0.2% chlorhexidine gel for 2 minutes and irrigated with physiological saline. The flap was enlarged to access a lingual mandibular torus in the ipsilateral premolar area, which was extracted and particulated to serve as an autograft. The flap was repositioned and sutured with 3.0 silk. The patient was re-instructed in oral hygiene, ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hrs x 4 days and mouthwash with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.12% twice daily x 2 weeks. Histopathological analysis showed epithelio-connective tissue with abundant lymphoplasmacytic and juxtaepithelial infiltrate. Under the superficial area, a dense fibro-connective tissue with few inflammatory cells was observed. Twelve months after surgical treatment, an X-ray showed marginal bone healing and a normal clinical appearance with no symptoms.  "
"A 38-year-old woman sought dental care for treatment of decay of tooth #37 (left mandibular second molar). At that time she had no medical or dental history of note, was not taking any medication and had no other restorations in her mouth. After intraoral examination and analysis of the periapical X-ray of the tooth in question, the tissue affected by the caries was removed and a class I cavity preparation of Black was made and filled with silver amalgam. No postoperative problems occurred. After 19 months, the patient returned to the dental office as she suspected caries in other teeth. Intraoral examination revealed an atrophic, slightly erythematous area on the left jugal mucosa, precisely in the region of the mucosa in contact with the molar restored with silver amalgam. The right jugal mucosa had a normal appearance. When asked about the lesion, the patient informed us that she had not noticed it, although recently she had sometimes felt a strange sensation in that area when eating spicy food. She also informed us that she had not received any type of treatment since the previous visit, when the amalgam restoration was performed. When asked about any history of allergy, she had no previous history of allergic reactions. Careful examination of the lesion shows that it projects onto the silver amalgam restoration, coming into intimate contact with it during certain oral movements, making it necessary to separate the mucosa with the mirror in order to be able to see the lesion properly.  To confirm the nature of the lesion histologically, a biopsy of the lesion is taken. The pathology study of the biopsy of the lesion showed squamous epithelium with irregular acanthosis and foci of parakeratosis, with marked spongiosis and the presence of exocytosis of lymphocytic elements in the stratum corneum. The underlying stroma showed a chronic lymphocyte-like inflammatory infiltrate distributed discretely in a band, with involvement of the stratum basale. In depth, fibroconnective and adipose tissue was observed with some thin-walled vascular structures, without relevant alterations. The anatomopathological diagnosis was compatible with oral lichen planus, the histological picture observed in the mucosa being equivalent in the skin to an acute-subacute dermatitis.  Once the nature of the lesion was explained to the patient and the possibility of it disappearing by removing the silver amalgam restoration, she decided not to replace the restoration as she felt that she had no significant discomfort and did not wish to undergo the treatment again. Restorations of other teeth were made with composite resin, without any mucosal reaction.  "
"In June 2003, a 40-year-old female patient from and resident of a town near Guatemala City presented for consultation referred by her general dentist with an asymptomatic dark brown pigmented macule, discovered during a routine clinical examination. The lesion was located on the anterior mucosa of the hard palate, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter. The patient had no relevant medical history and was in good health. She reported not taking any medication. The patient had lost her upper incisors through exodontia and was wearing a removable partial denture made of acrylic, inadequately designed, which caused pressure erythema of the underlying mucosa, candidiasis was ruled out by exfoliative cytology.  An excisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia using the punch technique with a 0.6 cm diameter instrument. The surgical site healed by second intention without complications. The tissue obtained from the biopsy was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed routinely. Microscopic examination with haematoxylin-eosin stain revealed a mucosal fragment lined by mildly acanthotic stratified squamous epithelium with spongiosis, containing numerous dendritic melanocytes. The underlying connective tissue showed the presence of melanin pigment admixed with a mild lymphocyte-predominant inflammatory infiltrate. The definitive diagnosis was melanoacanthosis.   "
"A 42-year-old woman attended the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital in Santander (Spain) for several days of discomfort in the right temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The patient reported clicking of the right TMJ for several years with no other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination revealed no dento-skeletal abnormalities. She presented a maximum painless oral opening (MAO) of 45 mm, reciprocal TMJ clicking (at the beginning of opening and at the end of closing), posterior deviation and protrusion greater than 10 mm. Selective pain on palpation of the right masseter and pterygoids. A panoramic radiograph was taken showing left condylar duplication.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both TMJ showed the presence of anterior displacement of the disc, which was reduced to the opening in the right TMJ. In the left TMJ, the morphology of the condyle was striking: anteroposterior bifidity and the presence of a grade II joint effusion. To complete the imaging study, a computerised tomography (CT) scan of both TMJs was requested, which confirmed the existence of an anteroposterior bifid left condyle with no evidence of degenerative changes.  The patient was treated conservatively with an unloading splint, muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatory drugs, local heat and a soft diet. With this treatment she improved clinically and is currently followed up in routine check-ups in our outpatient department.  "
"The patient was a 43-year-old man who consulted for a palpable lump, painful on pressure in the right preauricular region. Physical examination revealed a poorly defined mass measuring 2 cm in the right parotid area, with no other significant findings. The patient reported no personal or family history of interest, only the aforementioned nodule which, according to the patient, had been present for more than five years. The imaging tests performed, computerised axial tomography and ultrasound, showed a well-defined tumour measuring 2.5 x 2 cm centred in the parotid gland, which did not affect bone or muscle structures, suggestive of a low-grade tumour.  Fine needle aspiration puncture of the lesion was performed, using the routine method of 3 passes with a 23G needle, with the help of the Cameco® (manual aspiration device) after which 2 slides were fixed in alcohol to be stained using the Papanicolaou technique and the rest (6 slides) were air-dried to use the Diff-Quick stain. Examination of the smears shows, against a seroproteinaceous background, abundant large cellularity, with central and occasionally peripheral rounded nuclei, little patent nucleolus and finely granular chromatin. The cytoplasm is very characteristic, being abundant, pale and foamy with vague borders, vacuolated and containing abundant purplish granules. The cells are arranged in more or less compact clusters of large two-dimensional sheets, sometimes adopting an acinar architectural pattern. Along with this predominant cellularity, smaller cells with scant cytoplasm and small, round or oval, central nuclei are also present. The cytological image was therefore consistent with serous-type acinar cell pathology, probably carcinoma, and it was therefore proposed to perform DNA quantification by image cytometry on cytological smears. Given that the smears obtained in the first puncture did not allow an adequate assessment, a second FNA was performed in order to process the material for cytometric determination, for which purpose they were fixed in 99º methyl alcohol and subsequently stained with Gill's progressive haematoxylin.  Using TEXCAN® software and a video camera integrated into the microscope, which captures grey scales, the most relevant biological parameters are determined, including ploidy, S phase, and percentage of cells above 5c (aneuploidy), expressed as a histogram (IMAGE 2), reveals an euploidy of 2.1 with no relevant S-phase activity and no cells above 5c, thus indicating low aggressiveness (histogram type 1) according to Azúa's classification for static cytometry. With the cytological diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma and the cytometric prognostic index of low grade, conservative surgery was performed, with excision of the parotid gland without cervical emptying and preserving the facial nerve. Macroscopically we found a whitish piece, with a polylobulated morphology, weighing 12 grams and measuring 8 x 4 x 3 cm in total. The cut showed a 1.5 cm nodular lesion that did not overflow the surgical resection ends, apparently non-cystyphoid. Multiple parallel sections of the specimen were made and embedded in paraffin and then stained with conventional haematoxylin-eosin. Histopathological examination revealed a solid, well-circumscribed, microcystic neoformation composed mainly of acinar cells that did not overflow the glandular capsule. The multiple cystic spaces of very small size, scattered between the solid sheets are formed by dilated lumina lined by intercalated ductal cells, although acinar cells also occasionally participate. The acinar cells are serous secreting, as demonstrated by PAS (periodic acid Schiff) staining which highlights intracytoplasmic zymogen granules as well as intracystic eosinophilic secretion. The neoplasm respects the resection edges and there is no evidence of vascular or nerve infiltration.  The definitive diagnosis is, therefore, low-grade acinar cell carcinoma, well demarcated, without invasion of the surgical edges.  "
"A 67-year-old woman consulted our department for swelling in the posterior region of the right hemipalate. A biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia with the diagnosis of PLGA. The cervical examination revealed a right submandibular lymphadenopathy. The most relevant antecedent was a radiotherapy treatment in childhood for an unclassified pathology in the head and neck region. The orthopantomography was normal. A cervicofacial computerised tomography was requested, which showed a stage IV lesion at the level of the right nostril (T4N2CMx). A cytological puncture of the submandibular adenopathy was performed and reported as probable PLGA. MRI showed a well-defined lesion at the level of the nasal fossa with extension towards the pterygoid region.  Surgical intervention under general anaesthesia was decided. The tumour was approached by means of a Lefort I type maxillotomy. A unilateral suprahomohyoid cervical ganglionic cervical emptying was also performed. Tumour resection and bone repositioning of the maxilla was performed using 1.5 mm preformed mini-plates.  The definitive result of the pathological anatomy confirmed the diagnosis of PLGA, with invasion of surgical margins at the level of the right pterygomaxillary area. Metastatic adenopathies (2/16) were detected on the right side (5).  The patient was presented at the Maxillofacial Surgery-Oncology session, and it was decided to perform adjuvant radiotherapy in the right pterygomaxillary region and to follow imaging controls by means of resonance imaging. Given the persistence of tumour remains, it was decided to extend the surgical margins in the right pterygomaxillary region and reconstruct the defect using a buccal adipose Bichat ball. Two years later, the patient is still undergoing periodic check-ups and is free of disease.  "
"A 49 year old male patient was referred to our centre following the exodontia of a third molar in the fourth quadrant and curettage of granulation tissue at the apical and distal level of the exodontia. The only personal history of interest was a smoking habit of 35 paq.-year and an alcoholic intake of 150g/d. The patient's family history included the death of his father from colon cancer. The symptoms on physical examination were pain and inflammation in the region of tooth 48 of several months' evolution, which did not improve after the tooth was exodonated, also presenting a bulge of bony consistency on palpation in the vestibular region of the fourth quadrant and with strictly normal mucosa on physical examination.  After analysis of the tissue extracted during the exodontia of tooth 48 by the Pathological Anatomy Service, it was reported as squamous cell carcinoma with well-differentiated cells. A clinical-radiological extension study was carried out at head and neck level, where a destructive neoformative lesion was found on computerised tomography affecting the body and mandibular branch and multiple right cervical adenopathies at all levels. At thoracic-abdominal level there was no evidence of distant neoplastic pathology and the general blood analysis showed no alteration in any of its parameters. The case was discussed in the Functional Head and Neck Unit (UFCC) of our centre and was classified as a T2N2bM0 and radical surgical treatment was decided together with radiotherapy treatment using a three-field isocentric technique and concomitant chemotherapy. A segmental mandibulectomy was performed from part 43 to the right subcondylar region, modified radical right cervical lymph node removal, temporal tracheostomy and reconstruction by means of microvascularised osteomyocutaneous fibula graft. The pathological anatomy catalogues the piece as Keratinising Squamous Carcinoma and involvement of 23 of the 35 lymph nodes removed with extracapsular invasion of the same, classifying it as pT2pN2b.  3.5 months after surgery, recurrence was observed after a new cervical CT scan due to the appearance of cervical tumours compatible with massive recurrence in the form of multiple bilateral adenopathies. The possibility of a new cycle of chemotherapy was discussed but ruled out due to the rapid massive recurrence, the lack of response to treatment and the low level of tolerance to chemotherapy on the part of the patient. The patient was referred for palliative care and died 6.5 months after surgery due to massive loco-regional recurrence.   "
"Patient aged 67 years, smoker of 6 cigarettes/day. Previously diagnosed with breast cancer (T2 N0 M0) treated by surgery associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Due to metastatic progression of the breast carcinoma, treatment was started with bisphosphonates (pamidronate at a dose of 90 mg e.v. 20 cycles). After the first 9 cycles of pamidronate, the patient was referred to our Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department by her oncologist due to a burning sensation and diffuse gingival pain with habitual gingivorrhoea, presenting an ulcerous lesion 5 mm in diameter on the lateral edge of the right hemilengua, which was very painful. Exodontia of the molar associated with the lingual decubitus lesion and four other non-viable teeth were indicated, with a bone exposure lesion appearing approximately one month after each exodontia at the site of the extractions. Limited debridement of the bone necrosis was performed, supplemented with antibiotherapy (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clarithromycin) and chlorhexidine gel. The evolution was favourable in all areas except for the mandibular molar, where the exposure of the bone perpetuated the lingual decubitus, requiring a second, more aggressive ostectomy. Although this exposure did not completely disappear, the patient's pain was well controlled as the lingual lesion disappeared.    "
"A 62-year-old man diagnosed in September 2003 radiologically by CT scan of a stenosing tumour of the sigmoid colon with metastases in regional lymph nodes and liver (stage IV). Endoscopic biopsies were taken of the neoplasm, the diagnosis of which was intestinal adenocarcinoma. It was considered unresectable and was treated with a palliative shotgun colostomy in the transverse colon and first-line chemotherapy with FOLFOX protocol (oxaliplatin-5-fluorouracil-leucovorin). He was re-evaluated after 6 cycles, showing tumour stabilisation, and at the end of 12 cycles tumour progression was observed with distant lymph node and adrenal metastases. In March 2004, the patient presented with mandibular pain and swelling of 3 weeks' duration, and a vegetating tumour was observed in the right anterior mandibular gum. A cervical CT scan showed a solid lesion in the right hemimandible eroding bone, 4 cm in diameter, compatible with gingival neoplasia, without lymphadenopathy. A biopsy was performed, showing a neoformation independent of the surface mucosa, which was composed of atypical, irregular glands of variable shapes and sizes, with a columnar lining and abundant mitoses. Using immunohistochemistry techniques, the tumour was positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), and negative for CK7, which led to a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma highly compatible with intestinal origin. He received 4 cycles of second-line chemotherapy according to the FOLFORI protocol (CPT11-5 fluorouracil-leucovorin), and gingival analgesic radiotherapy, with disease progression and progressive deterioration being observed, and exiting 9 months after diagnosis of the gingival metastasis. No necropsy was performed.   "
"Female patient, 44 years old, referred to our unit due to an increase in volume in the zygomatic region and progressive limitation of mouth opening of 10 months of evolution. The medical history was not relevant. The extraoral physical examination showed facial asymmetry due to an increase in volume in the left cheek, with diffuse limits, bony consistency, painless, with normal skin appearance. The mouth opening was 30 mm. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) was normal on palpation, with no noises or pain on opening. On orthopantomography we observed an enlarged left coronoid process. The diagnostic hypothesis was a coronoid tumour.  An incision was made over the anterior border of the mandibular ramus, disinserting all the insertions of the temporalis muscle. A fibrous pseudocapsule was found around the enlargement, which was released. Coronoidectomy was performed. The buccal opening was immediately restored to 43 mm. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged after 48 hours. Histopathological study reported the presence of fibres, neoformation bone and hyaline cartilage tissue. The diagnosis was osteochondroma. Subsequent check-ups were uneventful. Definitive discharge was given at 10 months, with almost complete remodelling of the cheek deformity.   "
"A nine year old paediatric patient, with no clinical history of interest, was referred to the paediatric maxillofacial surgery unit for presenting dental inclusion. The radiological study showed an inclusion of the lower left canine, with a radiolucent area around 33, and she was admitted for surgical correction, with a preoperative diagnosis of follicular cyst. The surgical treatment carried out consisted of the removal of the ""follicular cyst"" with curettage of the bone cavity and extraction of the included canine, with subsequent filling with ""Bio-oss"" bone, the post-surgical evolution being satisfactory. The surgical specimen obtained through curettage comprised several irregular fragments of greyish colour and low consistency that together measured 0.8 x 0.7 cms and a canine (0.9 x 0.5 cms) resulting from the exodontia. The histological study showed an unaltered tooth structure, accompanied by fragments of fibrous tissue inside which there were numerous solid nests of odontogenic epithelial elements arranged in compact micronodular formations with a swirling cellular arrangement. The elements forming these structures were basaloid in morphology, with monomorphous, oval or fusiform nuclei, somewhat hyperchromatic, although without evidence of divisional activity. Mixed with these structures were glanduliform formations, sometimes tubular in appearance, with a lining of cylindrical, homogeneous cells and nuclei often polarised towards their base. At intercellular level and in a scattered manner, small calcified basophilic spherules appeared as well as areas of irregular contour of amorphous and hyaline deposit, PAS + diastase resistant, positive to Congo Red although green refringence to polarised light was not observed. In view of these data, a diagnosis of follicular adenomatoid odontogenic tumour associated with retention of the canine dental structure was made.  From the resected soft tissue material, an immunohistochemical study was carried out, which firstly showed a reactivity of the proliferating elements, both in the nodular and adenomatoid areas, against the AE1-3 keratin cocktail. Nuclear positivity for the p63 protein (a marker of basal or progenitor cells) was also observed, this nuclear reactivity being present in both the glanduliform areas and in the swirling nests of spindle cells.  The proliferation marker Ki-67 marks only 2-3% of the constituent cells of the tumour lesion, with positivity often appearing in clusters of spindle cell nodules. Detection of the melanin differentiation markers HMB45 and Melan-A was negative as was detection of the hormone receptors oestrogen (ER) and progesterone (PRg) and beta-2-microglobulin.   "
"A 42 year old female patient, with no personal history of interest, was referred by her GP to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves in Granada for presenting multiple papillomatous lesions on the upper lip which, according to the patient, had been present for approximately fifteen years. The patient's intraoral examination also revealed the presence of a scrotal tongue. Under local anaesthesia and in two surgical procedures, the lesions were completely excised. Pathological examination of the lesions classified them as fibropapillomas.  Due to the characteristic cobblestone appearance of the mucosal lesions, accompanied in the systemic exploration by cutaneous trichilemmomas in acral regions, the long period of evolution of the lesions and the presence of a direct family history (mother who died of thyroid neoplasia at the age of 49 with the presence of the same type of lesions on the labial mucosa, sister with non-filial mammary pathology, and sister with a non-filial mammary pathology), the patient was diagnosed with fibropapillomas, sister with unaffiliated breast pathology and daughter operated on for papillary thyroid carcinoma) it was decided to refer the patient to the Gynaecology Department for screening for neoplastic breast pathology, given the strong suspicion, among the differential diagnoses proposed, of Cowden's syndrome.  At the gynaecology department of our hospital, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral fibrocystic breast disease and infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade GII of the left breast, requiring lumpectomy plus homolateral axillary emptying and complementary treatment with postoperative chemo-radiotherapy. Given the clinical diagnosis of multiple hamartoma genodermatosis (the patient had one pathognomonic lesion, one major criterion and three minor criteria), a complete systemic tumour screening process was initiated. The patient was evaluated in the Digestive Service, where the presence of asymptomatic polyps in the rectal and colonic mucosa was detected and she was referred to the Endocrinology Service for evaluation of progressive thyroid enlargement associated with clinical hyperthyroidism. After ruling out malignancy by cytohistological study, the patient was operated on by the Endocrine Surgery Service and underwent total thyroidectomy. The conclusive anatomopathological result diagnosed the lesion as a multinodular colloid goitre. Five months after the thyroid surgery and after a routine abdominopelvic ultrasound scan, a mass was detected in the right kidney which, after a CT scan, showed radiological characteristics of malignancy. Referred to the Urology Department, it was decided to perform a radical right nephrectomy plus supracaval lymphadenectomy. Histological study of the surgical specimen diagnosed the lesion as clear cell and granular renal carcinoma with a mainly tubular component. No additional post-surgical treatment was required. At present, the patient has a progressive decrease in visual acuity which is not being studied by the Ophthalmology Department. All the neoplastic processes diagnosed and treated were detected in early stages. At the moment the patient is in complete remission of all the tumour pathology diagnosed and treated. Despite having a clear clinical diagnosis almost from the beginning, the patient has been studied at the National Centre for Oncological Research [Department of Human Genetics], confirming definitively that she is a carrier of the c1093lnaGGAT mutation in the PTEN gene, which ratifies the genetic diagnosis of Cowden Syndrome. The study has been extended to the rest of the first-degree relatives in order to carry out an adequate screening and initiate a close clinical follow-up if necessary.   "
"LTR. Male patient, 32 years of age, with no medical history of interest, who came for consultation for implant treatment due to loss of the upper right central incisor. The radiological examination (orthopantomography) showed a residual root cyst at the level of the lost tooth. The patient was recommended the possibility of a treatment plan consisting of the removal of the cyst, bone regeneration of the bone defect and insertion of an implant in the same operating session. Subsequently, after a healing period, rehabilitation with an implant-supported cemented crown is carried out. The patient is informed of the surgical technique and the prosthodontic aspects (provisional and definitive prosthesis), timing (duration of treatment, number of visits) and follow-up (clinical and radiological check-ups), and of the possibility of complications and loss of implants. The patient authorises the implant treatment by means of an informed consent form. Surgery The day before surgery, the patient starts a preventive antibiotic regimen (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) for one week, and in case of pain or inflammation, ibuprofen is prescribed. In addition, a daily chlorhexidine rinse is recommended for the first 30 days. The root cyst is removed with curettage and the implant bed is made, inserting a universal external connection implant with Nanoblast® nanosurface (Galimplant, Sarria, Spain) submerged. The entire bone defect is filled with KeraOs® tricalcium beta-phosphate (Keramat, Coruña, Spain) and covered with a BioGide® resorbable collagen membrane (Geistlich, Wolhusen, Switzerland). 8 months after implant insertion, the second surgery is performed with placement of a healing screw.  Prosthodontics 2 weeks after the second surgery, the implant was functionally loaded by placing the corresponding implant-supported prosthesis, a porcelain crown cemented on a machined hexagonal metal abutment.  Clinical follow-up The time elapsed since the implant was functionally loaded was 12 months. There have been no complications during this period.   "
"The patient is a 22 year old male, asthenic, asthenic, slim and thin, who has been coming to our health centre repeatedly in the last month due to stabbing epigastric pain associated with nausea and postprandial vomiting that relieves the pain. The episodes have been occurring for 7 years, for which reason she has consulted the emergency services on multiple occasions, but no acute pathology has ever been found. She was admitted 3 years ago for one of these episodes, undergoing gastroscopy with gastric biopsy which was positive for H. pylori; she underwent eradication treatment with current triple therapy (omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin), with a subsequent negative breath test for H. pylori infection. Due to persistent symptoms, treatment was started with antiemetics and multiple proton pump inhibitors, with no long-term response. On admission, he was assessed by the Mental Health Service, as the symptoms of acute pain persisted, which subsided with vomiting, and he was diagnosed with an anxious-depressive syndrome with poor follow-up and non-compliance with treatment. He had no food or drug allergies. Currently, the pain subsided in the genupectoral position and with cannabis consumption. On examination we found a patient with stable vitals, with a BMI of 17.7. The abdomen was excavated, tympanic, soft and slightly painful on deep palpation in the epigastrium, with no palpable masses, adenopathies or megaliths. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities; no anaemia, negative inflammatory response markers, no liver or electrolyte abnormalities, total protein 5.8 g/dL (normal value 6.4 to 8.3 g/dL). The abdominal X-ray showed no signs of intestinal obstruction. A total abdominal ultrasound was performed in the supine decubitus position, with no evidence of relevant findings, for which reason we decided to consult the Digestive Service, where, after being assessed, a barium bowel transit was requested, with a delay of more than 8 hours due to slow gastric emptying due to a permanent decrease in calibre in the 3rd duodenal portion, suggestive of extrinsic compression, which did not prevent the distal passage of contrast, all compatible with vascular compression. In view of this finding, a CT angiography of the abdomen was performed, with the result of a vascular clamp that produced compression of the 3rd portion of the duodenum. The mesenteric clamp affected the duodenum and the left renal vein, producing compression and pre- and post-compression dilatation.   "
"The patient is a 68-year-old male, smoker of one pack a day for the last 40 years, with no known drug allergies. He is not hypertensive, diabetic or dyslipidaemic. He has undergone cataract surgery. Our patient had been seen in internal medicine a year earlier due to sciatica and oedema in the lower limbs that had been developing for a month. During the clinical examination, two hard, painless masses were casually palpated in both parotid glands, which led to a request for an ultrasound scan of these glands and a FNA of the lesions detected in them. His family doctor undertook to carry out both techniques (ultrasound and FNA). - Ultrasound report: ""At the level of the superficial lobe of the right parotid gland, two hypoechogenic nodular lesions of solid appearance were identified, one more lateral of 32 mm and with well-defined borders and the other more medial and deep of about 38 mm. At the level of the superficial lobe of the left parotid a hypoechogenic and heterogeneous nodular lesion (solid/microcystic), with mameloned contours and microcalcifications inside, vascularised and about 32 mm "".  - FNA report: - FNA of left parotid area: cytology negative for malignant cells, compatible with Warthin's tumour. - FNA of right parotid area: cytology negative for malignant cells, compatible with Warthin's tumour. (Bilateral). - MRI report: ""Multiple heterogeneous nodular lesions are observed in both parotid glands. Some of these lesions present multicystic areas, with hyperintense content, in relation to proteinaceous/hematic content and all of them present intense enhancement. Compatible with multicentric and bilateral Warthin's tumour"".  The patient is awaiting surgery by the maxillofacial surgery department for a multifocal and bilateral Warthin's tumour.   "
"A 79-year-old man with obesity, arterial hypertension (AHT), type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, AF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sleep apnoea syndrome. She came to the primary care clinic for dizziness with a sensation of spinning objects, especially when walking, which subsided at rest. She reported an increase in her usual dyspnoea. She had no loss of consciousness, chest pain, vomiting or cold sweats. He was receiving regular treatment with amlodipine, repaglinide, nitroglycerin (patches), acenocoumarol, atorvastatin, atenolol, acetylsalicylic acid, spironolactone, isophane protamine insulin, paracetamol-tramadol and omeprazole, with good compliance. Physical examination revealed the presence of arrhythmia on cardiac auscultation, with slow, muffled tones and no murmurs. Radial pulses were present and symmetrical. Pulmonary auscultation shows generalised hypoventilation, with no extra sounds. The neurological examination is strictly normal. There was oedema with fovea up to the knees and signs of chronic venous insufficiency in the lower limbs. Using a pulse oximeter, we detected a heart rate of 30 beats per minute (bpm) and an oxygen saturation of 90%. In view of the patient's symptoms (dizziness with a sensation of spinning objects, with no other added symptoms) and the heart rate detected, it was decided to perform an ECG.  After evaluating the ECG, and given the patient's personal history (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease), we compared the recording obtained with a previous ECG, taken three years earlier during an admission for an episode of exacerbation of COPD.  Comparing both electrocardiographic recordings, it was found that there was no bradycardia and that the QRS complexes now appeared rhythmic, but no P waves were seen, so, in view of the ECG obtained and the clinical findings, it was decided to refer the patient to the Hospital Emergency Department. With a suspected diagnosis of slow AF, negative chronotropic treatment was withdrawn, with no improvement. Given the lack of response to this measure, it was decided to admit the patient to Cardiology. After a complete study, a definitive diagnosis was made of AF with advanced atrioventricular block and right bundle branch block grade III, symptomatic, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted. The patient evolves favourably: the clinical symptoms disappear and the heart rate is controlled.   "
"This is a 57-year-old female patient with a history of ductal carcinoma of the left breast diagnosed in 1999 and ductal carcinoma ""in situ"" of the right breast in 2002, with no data of recurrence since then, who worked in a hospital laundry as an ironer. The patient has never smoked, but lives in a 65 square metre flat with her husband, a smoker of 30 cigarettes a day (black variety), with whom she has lived for 35 years, her son and daughter, both of whom are also smokers. The son is a smoker of 20 cigarettes a day, with whom she has lived for 31 years; and the daughter is a smoker of 10 cigarettes a day, with whom she has lived for 25 years. They all smoked inside the flat, none of them went out onto the terrace to smoke. She consulted for frank haematuria related to lumbar pain of a mechanical nature. Physical examination revealed no relevant findings, no palpable mass in the renal fossa. A urine culture, ultrasound and laboratory tests (haematology and general biochemistry) were requested. Laboratory tests were normal, except for proteinuria, and the urine culture was negative. The ultrasound was reported as ""without significant alterations, except for slight ectasia in the right upper caliceal group"". We decided that in the event of haematuria with positive proteinuria (confirmed in 24-hour urine), we would refer him to the nephrology department for further study and follow-up. A second ultrasound scan was performed, with the same results as the first (performed 6 months apart), as well as an intravenous urography showing dilatation of the pyelocaliceal and right ureter. The computerised tomography (CT) scan showed the same findings, with no obstructive cause for the dilatation. In the third ultrasound scan (months later) echogenic content was seen in the pyelocaliceal system of the right kidney, so a new CT scan was requested, where an image was found with soft tissue density affecting the upper infundibulum and renal pelvis in the intrarenal portion, causing dilatation of the upper calyx. The lesion is compatible with transitional cell carcinoma in the right collecting system, upper infundibulum and part of the renal pelvis. Urine cytology was positive. The patient underwent a laparoscopic right nephrectomy and ureterectomy.  The pathological anatomy confirmed transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis, with foci of mucinous carcinoma affecting the pelvis, infiltrating the parenchyma and respecting the ureteral borders, theoretical stage pT3. Almost two years later, a thoracic CT scan confirmed space-occupying lesions in the liver compatible with liver and bone metastases.   "
"A 7-year-old girl with no previous history of interest was referred from her primary care centre for presenting a lesion on the right cheek, somewhat pruritic and painful, which had not improved after oral treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, prescribed almost from the beginning during the previous two weeks. Examination revealed an erythematous-violaceous nodule on the right cheek, cold and soft to the touch, well demarcated, measuring 1.5 cm in diameter. No regional adenomegaly was palpable, although there was a slight keratosis pilaris on the skin of the cheeks.  Given the clinical suspicion of FAPF, and informed by the parents of the benignity of the process, it was agreed with them not to perform a skin biopsy and to prescribe regular follow-up, together with therapy with metronidazole gel at night. Two weeks later there was spontaneous drainage of a bloody-purulent material from the centre of the lesion, with subsequent progressive resolution of the nodule over the course of about 6 weeks. Cultures for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria from the draining exudate were negative. However, after resolution of the nodular lesion, residual telangiectasias persisted in the affected area, which have slowly attenuated over 10 months of follow-up. We advise the patient to undergo check-ups until complete resolution of the process and warn of the need to consult the doctor if symptoms or clinical signs suggestive of ocular rosacea appear (dryness or redness of the eye, blepharitis, chalazion, photophobia, loss of visual acuity).   "
"29-year-old single woman, living with her parents, with no history of organic or psychiatric pathology or drug abuse, admitted to neurology for behavioural alterations, disorientation and lack of connection with the environment. The family reported that it was the first episode of these characteristics, that for the last 2 weeks they had seen the patient discouraged, not very communicative (they did not identify any trigger or decompensating factor, the relationship with the patient was good, she had a good social support network, good job performance, etc.), she sometimes looked lost, even spoke incoherently (""the veins in her head were dry""), there was no alteration in her biological rhythms. All this was a cause for great family anxiety, so the family doctor was consulted, and she was treated as depressed and prescribed sertraline 50 mg/day (1 week before admission). The evolution was torpid, with episodes of psychomotor agitation and disorientation, which is why the family decided to take the patient to the emergency department. There was no family history of significant psychiatric or organic disease. On examination, apart from the spatio-temporal disorientation and agitation, nothing remarkable was found, and there was no neurological focality. Laboratory tests (haemogram, coagulation, liver function tests, renal, thyroid, urine, folic acid and vitamin B12) and brain tomography were normal. Urine toxins were negative. Lumbar puncture (LP) showed 26 leukocytes/mm3. In the ED she presented with a generalised tonic-clonic seizure and was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of viral encephalitis, and treatment was started with acyclovir and valproic acid. During her admission she was assessed by psychiatry. The family again reported that the patient had been listless for 2 weeks, repeating that she had ""dry veins in her head"". She was classified as psychotic depression and venlafaxine 75 mg/day was prescribed. Serology for HIV, Brucella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex, Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis and Epstein Barr were negative. During the first week of hospitalisation the patient was confused, presented with soliloquies and unmotivated laughter. LP was repeated (34 leucocytes/mm3, lymphocytes 100%, serology and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture for Brucella, Lúes and Borrellia were negative). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal. The antidepressant was discontinued and tiapride was prescribed. During the second week, electroencephalogram (EEG) showed signs of moderate diffuse slow encephalopathy. The patient was unresponsive to simple commands, mutative, stuporous, so tiapride was discontinued, leaving her on intramuscular haloperidol in case of agitation. Due to the torpid evolution, she was admitted to the ICU, discontinuing valproic acid and starting levetirazepam. The patient started to present involuntary movements and dystonia. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Megadoses of corticosteroids and haemin were added (suspected acute intermittent porphyria). Due to the most frequent complex tonic seizures, sedation and endotracheal intubation were decided. No uroporphyrins were detected, coproporphyrins and zinc were within normal limits (so haemin was discontinued). LP was repeated, with polymerase chain reaction for mycoplasma and mycobacteria being normal. During the fourth week, sedation was withdrawn: he responded to simple commands, had facial myoclonus and buccolingual movements, and extubation was performed. EEG continued to show signs of diffuse encephalopathy. Prion disease was ruled out (negative for CSF protein). The gynaecological ultrasound showed a slightly enlarged ovary. During the sixth week, ceruloplasmin, serum copper and abdominal ultrasound were normal. The patient was more conscious and reactive. The possibility of encephalitis was raised in relation to a teratoma that was not found. LP was repeated looking for the presence of paraneoplastic antibodies (anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-CV2, anti-fysin, anti-Tr and anti-calcium channel), which were negative, except for anti-NMDA antibodies. Psychiatry was called again due to psychomotor agitation and self-referential delusions, and ziprasidone 40 mg/day was started, reaching up to 160 mg/day with progressive improvement. The final diagnosis was encephalitis against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (ECR-NMDA) and psychotic disorder secondary to organic pathology (ECR-NMDA).   "
"A 22 year old male attended primary care (PC) with a personal history of functional murmur in childhood, seasonal allergic rhinitis, smoker of 10 cigarettes a day and weekend drinker. Family history of no interest. After performing an ECG at the primary care clinic prior to travelling abroad to study at a private university in the United Kingdom, a generalised negative T wave was observed from V2 to V6 and in the inferior face, with isolated ventricular extrasystoles. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 140/70 mm Hg, normal cardiopulmonary auscultation at 60 beats per minute with no other data of interest. With these electrocardiographic findings, he was referred to the cardiology department.  The complementary studies requested from the PC were normal (blood tests with haemogram, biochemistry and coagulation; lateral and posteroanterior chest X-ray). The echocardiogram showed significant dilatation of the right ventricle (55 mm), with a hypokinetic lateral face and mild tricuspid insufficiency. The holter monitor shows sinus rhythm and migratory atrial pacing with frequent ventricular extrasystoles and some ventricular triplets. Cardiac MRI shows an enlarged right ventricle with moderator band hypertrophy with thin wall with some hyperintense areas within it suggestive of fatty infiltration, with small dyskinetic sacculations. The left ventricle, valves and pericardium are normal. With the suspected diagnosis of ARVC, treatment with beta-blockers was started. The patient remained asymptomatic and underwent regular check-ups. Upon his return to Spain two years later, after playing a basketball game, he developed syncopal symptoms and it was finally decided to have an ICD implanted. One month after admission, he was referred to the Rehabilitation Service to assess the possibility of starting a Cardiac Rehabilitation Programme (CRP). The patient continues to lead an active life today, one year later, with follow-up from Primary Care and check-ups by Cardiology.   "
"A 13-year-old boy with a personal history of Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and hypothyroidism, on treatment with methylphenidate, risperidone and levothyroxine. He was referred to the dermatology department for a lesion on the right lower limb, which had been growing progressively for a year. It was asymptomatic, with no clinical signs such as pain or pruritus. She had not received any treatment, nor did she report any triggering factor. Examination revealed a plaque, indurated on palpation, with a central dyschromic area and a purplish halo, with a linear distribution in the mid-distal third of the right outer thigh. There were no other skin lesions or accompanying systemic symptoms.  Laboratory tests were requested, including a complete blood count, biochemistry, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and serology, urine test and biopsy of the lesion. The results were normal, with negative ANA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-Jo1 and anti-Scl70. Serology for Borrelia burgdorferi was negative and urinalysis showed no abnormalities. Histopathology was compatible with the diagnosis of morphea. Given a linear morphea in infancy without joint involvement or aesthetic deformity, it was decided to initiate topical corticosteroid treatment with fluticasone propionate, one application per day for 2 months, followed by topical calcipotriol, also one application per day. After almost a year of follow-up, the lesions have stabilised.   "
"A 59 year old patient who has had difficulty walking for about a month. She presents weakness and pain in the lower limbs, which improves after stopping, sometimes accompanied by non-radiating back pain. She has noticed changes in her voice, becoming more dysphonic, which she relates to her work. In the anamnesis she did not report weakness in her hands or upper limbs. There was no eye or sphincter control disorder, nor was there any sensory disorder. No emotional lability was noted, although the patient already had an adjustment disorder after the death of his wife. He reports occasional cramps in twins. Personal history: hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history: paternal uncle died with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the neurological examination he presented with hypophonic speech, centred facial expression. Normal internal and external ocular motility. Tongue twitching. No cervical weakness. Motor: lower limbs (lower limbs): paraparesis of proximal predominance 4/5. Dorsiflexion of both feet 5/5. No upper limb weakness. No sensory deficit. Osteo-tendon reflex (ROT) +++/+++ with bilateral Hoffmann positive and right cutaneous-plantar reflex indifferent, left preserved. Fasciculations in deltoid, pectoral and diffusely in MMII. Muscle atrophy in both quadriceps. General examination was unremarkable. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) was performed: right 1.18; left 1.29. Laboratory tests were requested, with a CK of 232, immunological study and normal serology. Chest and lumbosacral X-ray normal. Following suspicion of motor neurone disease, the Internal Medicine department was consulted and requested an electromyogram (EMG)/electroneurography (ENG) suggestive of a neurogenic pattern with active denervation in both MMII, right upper limb (fibrillations and positive waves), compatible with motor neurone disease, probably ALS. With these results, the patient was referred to Neurology. After assessment of the patient and with a diagnosis of probable ALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria, and pending completion of the study with cranial-medullary magnetic resonance imaging and a new neurolophysiological study, treatment was started with Riluzole 50 mg, one tablet every 12 hours. Due to the clinical evolution of the patient with proximal paraparesis in MMII, with significant muscle atrophy of both thighs, dysphagia for solids, without involvement of the upper limbs (MMSS) and correlated with the latest neurophysiological study, another possible diagnosis was considered, specifically myopathy. The EMG suggested myopathy with bulbar and pelvic girdle involvement (inclusion body myopathy), so a muscle biopsy was performed, the results of which were conclusive, ruling out the possibility of primary skeletal muscle disease and only showing changes secondary to denervation. The patient subsequently presented with a progression of symptoms, showing weakness in dorsal flexion of the left foot (4/5). Incipient atrophy at the level of the fifth interosseous space of the left hand. Diffuse fasciculations in different body segments, as well as mild aphonia. Finally, a diagnosis of motor neuron disease was suggested, probably ALS. Treatment was continued with Riluzole 50 mg. Speech therapy and physical and respiratory rehabilitation at home were recommended. Five months after the definitive diagnosis, the patient developed septic shock of urinary origin and subsequent complications, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (tracheotomy), percutaneous gastrostomy feeding (PEG) and secondary adaptive disorder, and was discharged home. Two months later, he presented with an exitus.   "
"We present the case of a 10-year-old boy with no past history of interest, with bilateral gonalgia, back pain and low back pain after a fall from a bicycle 4 days ago. On examination he had preserved active and passive mobility with pain in both lower limbs (MMII). There were no signs of fractures or neurological alterations. Rest, local cold and anti-inflammatory treatment was prescribed. After 48 hours, the patient returned for persistent pain, loss of strength, paresthesia in the lower limbs, difficulty in standing and walking and urinary incontinence. Physical examination revealed a decrease in strength and altered sensation in both LMMII. Suspecting transverse myelitis, the patient was referred to the hospital emergency department. On admission, blood tests were normal, the cerebrospinal fluid study revealed moderate pleocytosis, without the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands; the electroencephalogram showed no alterations and the evoked potentials showed paralysis and spasticity of MMII, hyporeflexia and bilateral Babinsky, absence of abdominal and cremasteric reflexes, hyperalgesia and dysaesthesia of the trunk and MMII. Electromyogram revealed impaired medullary somatosensory sensation through the posterior cords, with no conduction through the right cord and partial impairment of the left cord. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was normal, however, spinal MRI showed an expansive lesion at spinal cord level from D1 to D6 compatible with transverse myelitis.  Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient presented intense pain in the right eye with sudden loss of visual acuity. He was assessed by ophthalmology and a diagnosis of right optic neuritis was made. In view of the presence of transverse myelitis and optic neuritis, with brain MRI that did not meet multiple sclerosis criteria and spinal MRI showing a lesion of three or more spinal segments (D1 to D6), an anti-acuoporin-4 antibody test was performed, which was negative. Based on the clinical manifestations, evolution and despite the negative antibody, the patient was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica or Devic's disease (see diagnostic criteria table 1).  The patient was initially treated with intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 g/day without improvement, so plasmapheresis was performed with good clinical evolution. The patient was followed up by neurology, ophthalmology and urology with progressive improvement and progressive decrease of corticotherapy. Fourteen months later, the patient presented complete recovery of strength and sensitivity of the lower limbs, normal gait, normal reflexes, absence of spasticity, ataxia or dysmetria; occasionally he presented painful lumbar hyperaesthesia of a self-limited nature. In the right eye, he maintained blurred near vision, with attenuation of colour perception, although he managed to recover 70% of visual acuity. Nocturnal enuresis persists due to bladder spasticity, which continues to be treated with desmopressin.   "
"A 40-year-old woman attended the emergency department of the health centre for right unilateral otalgia and headache of 3 days' duration. She was treated as otitis externa with beclomethasone drops + clioquinol. The following day she returned to the emergency department for headache which subsided almost completely with intravenous analgesic therapy, adding dexketoprofen 25 mg/8 h to the previous treatment. Two days later he came to the consultation room reporting a throbbing headache, oppressive sensation at the periorbital level and tinnitus in the right ear, and the examination revealed no inflammation in the external auditory canal (EAC), selective hyperemia of the ossicular chain without tympanic alteration and discrete horizontal nystagmus, indicating treatment with levofloxacin 500 mg/24 h, betahistine and time off work. Two days later, he attended for the temporary incapacity report, reporting improvement of the ear pain, but a certain sensation of instability, and betahistine was replaced by sulpiride 50 mg/8h. Forty-eight hours later he consulted for ""not feeling better""; he noted paresthesia in the right hemicara since that same morning, ageusia in the right hemilanguage and during the interview we observed blepharospasm in the left eye, confirming in the examination a right peripheral facial paralysis (facial asymmetry when smiling and blowing, as well as a slight right ocular opening when told to close his eyes), for which he was referred to the hospital emergency department for otorhinolaryngological assessment. Audiometry showed a slight drop in acuity in the right ear. Cranial nerves were normal except for VII. There was no spontaneous nystagmus. Otoscopy showed hyperemia in the upper portion of the CAE and small vesicles were visualized in the right auricle, so she was admitted with the diagnosis of ""right Ramsay Hunt syndrome"" to start treatment with intravenous acyclovir and evolutionary control.   "
"We present the clinical case of a 33-year-old man who consulted for progressive enlargement of the right testicle over three months. He reported no pain or urinary symptoms. He had no allergies or pathologies of interest. He reported normal psychomotor development with no history of cryptorchidism or hydrocele during childhood. He denies alcohol, tobacco or other drug use. Physical examination revealed a diffuse increase in the size and consistency of the right testicle with negative transluminescence. The left testicle is normal. There were no palpable inguinal lymphadenopathies or in the rest of his anatomy. There was no gynaecomastia, visceromegaly or peritoneal irritation. We decided to perform a testicular ultrasound in primary care, and found a diffuse alteration of the ultrastructure without the presence of cysts or calcifications. We requested a complete blood analysis with tumour markers, a chest X-ray and a preferential referral to the urology department. Both haemogram and basic biochemistry were strictly normal, as were AFP, Beta-HCG and LDH. The chest X-ray was also normal. Given the long waiting time for the urology consultation, we decided to refer the patient to the hospital emergency department with the complete work-up performed in primary care. A regular testicular ultrasound was performed which confirmed: ""Right testicle increased in size with diffuse alteration of echogenicity, without calcifications, with diffuse increase in vascularisation. Inflammatory process of the right orchitis type, however, given the time of evolution, a neoplastic process cannot be ruled out"". He was admitted to Urology and a radical right inguinal orchiectomy was performed. Pathological anatomy reports: ""Classic seminoma with a diameter greater than 8 cm, without evidence of infiltration of the tunica albuginea. Remains of testicular parenchyma with foci of intratubular germinal tumour. Epididymis and resection edge of the spermatic cord with no evidence of malignancy. In view of these findings, an abdominopelvic computerised tomography (CT) scan was performed for staging: ""No mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy of significant size was observed. Right paracardiac adenopathy of 6 mm and micronodule of 4 mm in LM. No pathological retroperitoneal or pelvic lymphadenopathy was observed. There were findings compatible with mesenteric panniculitis and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy with a reactive appearance secondary to surgery. The rest of the study showed no other findings. He was referred to Oncology with the diagnosis of pure stage I seminoma. Given that more than 80% of cases never relapse, in correlation with the European Association of Urology Guidelines, it was decided to perform surveillance without the need for adjuvant treatment. However, the small but clinically significant risk of recurrence supports the need for long-term surveillance2 and initiation of salvage radiotherapy or cisplatin-based chemotherapy. As recurrences occur mainly in the first 2 years, follow-up CT scanning is recommended every 3 months in the first year, every 4 months in the second year and every 6 and 12 months in the following years3. Our patient has been followed up for more than 3 years, with no data of relapse. The non-specific findings present in the first CT scan have disappeared and tumour markers remain negative to date.   "
"The patient is a 12-year-old male born at term with the use of forceps for stationary dilatation. Apgar and other postpartum examinations were normal. Rest was indicated during the last trimester of pregnancy due to threatened labour. During the postnatal period she presented delayed psychomotor development. At 3 years of age, she presented with absence seizures without subsequent epileptic seizures or need for treatment. Currently, she presents moderate mental retardation, learning difficulties, severe behavioural alterations in the autism spectrum, sphincter control deficit and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, treated first with methylphenidate without improvement and, subsequently and up to the present, with antioxidants and improvement of the disorder. He also has social anxiety and extreme phobias to noises and animals, hypersensitivity to sounds, textures and certain foods, as well as chewing difficulties and secondary vomiting, generalised hypotonia, lax joints, valgus feet that have required surgery, and a significant sleep disturbance treated with melatonin. He has no cardiological or dysautonomic alterations or characteristic facial features. The patient has an older healthy brother, but has a second cousin on the maternal side, aged 33 years, diagnosed at the age of 13 years with FXS after genetic testing. At that time the entire maternal side of the family was genetically tested and it was reported orally, without a written report, that both the patient's mother and her sisters were healthy carriers. This condition was not sufficiently appreciated by the family in the face of successive healthy children of the case patient's sisters and healthy brother. The case patient's mother did not receive genetic counselling or prenatal diagnosis indications in either of her two pregnancies. Only at her request was genetic analysis performed in the postnatal period in both cases.   "
"An 18-year-old woman was referred from the emergency department by the Internal Medicine service for blurred vision in both eyes of 5 days' evolution. Her only history was hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine 100 micrograms/day, and headaches for which treatment with nadolol 40 mg/night and topiramate 25 mg in the mornings had recently been prescribed. He provides a recent analytical study, prior to treatment, within the normal range. His ophthalmological clinical history showed a previous visual acuity, 6 months earlier, of unity (10/10) in both eyes with a correction of +0.50 sphere -0.75 cylinder at 100° in the right eye and +0.75 sphere -0.75 cylinder at 75° in the left eye. A new refractive study was performed which determined a myopic change in both eyes with -4.25 sphere -0.50 cylinder at 110o in the right eye and -3.75 sphere -1.00 cylinder at 60o in the left eye, a correction with which he achieved visual acuity equal to 0.6 (6/10) in the right eye and 0.7 (7/10) in the left eye.  The biomicroscopic study showed mild hyperemia and conjunctival congestion in both eyes, narrow anterior chambers with a positive eclipse sign and transparent corneas and crystalline lenses, with no signs of inflammation or seclusion. Pupils are isochoric and normoreactive. Normal ocular motility. Intraocular pressure measured with applanation tonometer was 32 mmHg in the right eye and 29 mmHg in the left eye. Papillae and posterior pole examination were normal.  On suspicion of acute angular closure, oral treatment was started with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide 250 mg), ½ cp every 8 hours, and topical treatment with bimatoprost and timolol maleate in eye drops, with discontinuation of the recently introduced medications (nadolol and topiramate). At 24 hours he showed blood pressure of 23 mmHg in both eyes, and 13 mmHg in the right eye and 12 mmHg in the left eye at 48 hours, with normalisation of anterior chamber depth, so acetazolamide treatment was progressively reduced at 48 hours, third and fourth day until total suppression and topical treatment was withdrawn after 7 days, maintaining normal blood pressure of 17-18 mmHg in both eyes at 3, 6 and 12 weeks, without treatment.  Vision was completely normalised at 72 hours, with visual acuity equal to unity in both eyes and refraction similar to that prior to the episode. A final diagnosis of myopisation and ocular hypertension due to acute angular closure secondary to treatment with topiramate was made, which was communicated to the patient, family and Internal Medicine service as the prescriber of the drug.   "
"Patient 3 years old (94 cm, 10 kg), girl, Afghan, with signs of malnutrition, who presented with second degree burns in the anterior and posterior region of the right thigh, right flank and mesogastrium (25% of the body surface burned) secondary to an explosion 4 days ago. Topical treatment was applied but proved ineffective. Due to the torpid evolution of the lesion, local mechanical debridement and application of argentic sulphadiazine and Tulgrasum® healing dressing impregnated with antibiotic (bacitracin-zinc, neomycin, polymyxin B sulphate) was decided. To allow the procedure to proceed, midazolam (1 mg i.m.) was administered beforehand and ketamine (60 mg i.m.) after 5 minutes. Analgesia (grade 0 on the verbal pain scale) and sedation was achieved after 10 minutes (score 4 on the Ramsay scale), allowing the procedure to be performed without incident for 22 minutes. The patient recovered sensation and wakefulness 120 minutes after treatment. The degree of amnesia of the surgical procedure assessed by the Korttila and Linnolia scale was total.   "
"A 63-year-old heterosexual male was admitted in November 2013 for progressive dyspnoea of one month's duration, which on arrival at the emergency department was minimal effort. He was a smoker, cumulative rate of 80 packs/year, drinker of about 80 grams of alcohol per day, and had unprotected sex with different partners. He reported no previous liver disease, nor was he aware of any family member having been diagnosed with porphyria. She was not taking medication on a regular basis. A few months earlier, she had consulted a dermatologist for erythema and facial desquamation, which was related to excessive photosensitivity, and was treated with sun protection creams. In addition to the respiratory difficulty, he had a non-productive cough, no fever, but on admission his temperature was 38.5oC, and he estimated that he had lost about 20 kg of weight in the last 4 months. The patient appeared to be malnourished, was eupnoeic with supplemental oxygen, bladder murmur was preserved and there were no signs of heart failure. There was a striking hyperpigmentation on the forehead, malar regions and nose with some small erosion and hypertrichosis, he had no other skin lesions. Chest X-ray showed a bilateral interstitial pattern. Anti-HIV antibodies were positive, the viral load was 257,580 copies/ml, CD4 28 cells/µL and CD8 262 cells/µL with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.11. Ziehl Neelsen staining of sputum was negative. An adequate sample for direct sputum immunofluorescence against pneumocystis jiroveci (PNJ) could not be obtained, however empirical treatment against this fungus was started with a presumptive diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia due to PNJ. The dyspnoea and the radiological semiology described improved. A urine fractionated porphyrin assay was performed to clarify the facial erythroderma. An elevated 24-hour urine porphyrin excretion was detected, with an excretion pattern compatible with the diagnosis of PCT2.  Hepatitis B and C virus serologies were negative. The iron metabolism study showed normal transferrin values and slightly elevated transferrin saturation index and serum iron, serum ferritin quantification was very high (1,928 ng/ml). The C282Y and H63D mutations of the haemochromatosis gene were negative. He was discharged with the diagnoses of HIV infection C3 (NPC interstitial pneumonia) and PCT. Treatment with Tenofovir, Emtricitabine and Darunavir was started and sun protection and abstinence from alcohol were recommended.   "
"We present the case of a 29-year-old male (165 cm, 68 kg), Afghan, police officer, who suffered an open traumatism to the right elbow during an attack secondary to the impact of a firearm (probably AK-74 7.62 mm). Following the incident, a tourniquet was placed at humeral level, a granulated haemostatic was applied topically (Celox® SAM Medical Products, Newport, Oregon, USA) and tranexamic acid (1 g iv) was administered. He was evacuated by medical helicopter to the Spanish Role 2E in Herat (Afghanistan) arriving at the triage room 70 minutes after sustaining the injury.  On primary assessment, the wounded man had GCS 15 pts, peripheral SatO2 98%, heart rate 110 bpm, non-invasive blood pressure 130/80 mmHg and good pain control (VAS 2/10) after administration of midazolam (3 mg iv) and ketamine (30 mg iv). The presence of a gunshot wound with entry wound in the elbow without exit wound was confirmed. X-ray showed a fracture of the left distal humerus, a fracture of the left proximal ulna and a fracture of the left proximal radius. Surgical intervention was decided for debridement, cleaning, removal of bone splinters and placement of an external fixator on the left arm under general anaesthesia. During the pre-anaesthetic study, no significant alterations were found in the blood analysis, ECG or airway assessment. The patient could not remember when he had last eaten and accepted the informed consent in the presence of an interpreter. In the operating theatre, grade I monitoring (peripheral O2 SatO2, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and capnography) augmented with a bispectral analysis device (BIS®), continuous haemoglobin monitor (Masimo® Radical 7) and oropharyngeal thermometer was used. The casualty was premedicated with midazolam (1 mg iv) and ketamine (20 mg iv). After 3 minutes of denitrogenation with 80% FiO2 achieving 100% SatO2, rapid sequence anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (150 μg iv), propofol (130 mg iv) and rocuronium (30 mg iv). Standard laryngoscopy (Cormak II) was performed, the airway was isolated with a 7.5 mm endotracheal tube and the pneumotaping balloon was filled with air (8 ml). After selecting protective ventilation parameters (VT 420 ml, PEEP 7, FiO2 45%) no alveolar recruitment manoeuvres were necessary. Anaesthetic maintenance was performed with a mixture of O2, air and sevofluorane. During the 75 minutes of the surgical procedure the patient remained tachycardic. The intervention performed was open reduction under scopic control, transarticular osteosynthesis by implantation of Hoffmann II Stryker external fixator in multiplanar configuration, pulsatile lavage of the wound and debridement of the necrotic tissue involving the extesor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi ulnaris and tricipital tendon. Anti-tetanus prophylaxis, antibiotic (cefazolin 2 g iv and metronidazole 500 mg iv), gastroprotective (omeprazole 40 mg iv), anti-emetic (granisetron 3 mg iv), anti-inflammatory (desketoprofen 50 mg iv), ocular (oculo-epithelial ointment together with forced eyelid closure), orthopaedic (joint protection) and thermal (operating room temperature regulation, fluid warmer and hot air blanket). To improve pain control, in addition to multimodal analgesia (metamizole 2 g iv, paracetamol 1 g iv, ketamine 30 mg iv and fentanyl 150 μg iv), an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block was used at the interscalene level using 37 mg of bupivacaine 0.25%. Education was uneventful and no opioid antagonisation or muscle relaxant reversal was required. The patient was admitted stable and with good pain control to the intensive care unit and subsequently transferred to the inpatient ward. He was discharged from Role 2E 72 hours after the attack and evacuated to an Afghan military hospital for soft tissue healing and future osteosynthesis.   "
"Five-year-old male patient who, after suffering an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack in a public place, was evacuated to a local health care centre and was first diagnosed with a diaphyseal fracture of the left femur. The fracture was not adequately reduced and he was immobilised in a splint. He was evacuated to the second Spanish military surgical echelon ROLE 2 in Herat, Afghanistan for definitive treatment.  After noting the unacceptable fracture reduction, it was decided to carry out a surgical procedure of Damage Control Orthopaedics consisting of a reduction and immobilisation by external fixation. In the absence of TENS-type elastic endomedullary rods or external fixators for the paediatric age group, external fixation by means of an external wrist fixator (used as a circumstantial method) on the left femoral diaphysis was decided upon. In the operating theatre and after anaesthetic optimisation, the surgical procedure is performed, which involves debridement of the necrotic soft tissues with profuse pulsatile lavage. Scopy confirmed the presence of a transverse and unstable femoral diaphysis fracture. Closed reduction with scopic control of the fracture was performed, and an external fixation technique was carried out by implanting a Stryker™ TRIAX external fixator (wrist and small fragment external fixator used here as a method of circumstance) in a monoplane and monotube configuration. Two proximal pins and two distal pins and check under scopia for correct pin placement.   "
"A 22-year-old man (68 kg., 172 cm.), active military, with no previous history of interest, who was hit by a projectile (9 mm. calibre), from an accidental pistol shot, at close range, in the right thigh. After primary assessment and initial care he was evacuated to the HGD ""Orad y Gajías"", where he was diagnosed with a fracture of the distal third of the right femur, open Gustilo type III, comminuted, and without displacement. In the rest of the examination no lesions were observed. Exhaustive cleaning and debridement of the wounds on the right thigh was carried out, and the right lower limb was immobilised by means of a posterior cruropedic splint. Antibiotic prophylaxis, tetanus prophylaxis and antithrombotic prophylaxis were instituted.  In the tertiary assessment of the patient at the ""Gómez Ulla"" hospital, an axial CT scan of the right femur was performed, with multiplanar and volumetric reconstructions. A comminuted fracture of the distal third of the right femur was determined, with multiple small fragments displaced to the posterior compartment. After presentation of the case in a clinical session of the service, surgical treatment was decided using an external fixator.  Surgical intervention was performed by placing an XCaliber external fixator (Orthofix®) with four femoral pins, in static and monoplanar configuration under intradural regional anaesthesia and sedation. No surgical or anaesthetic incidents were recorded during the operation.  The injured patient had a good postoperative evolution, starting partial loading 24 hours after the operation. Five days after hospital admission, the patient was discharged home, with subsequent clinical-radiological follow-up on an outpatient basis. Two months after the operation, the patient had limited knee joint balance and delayed healing at the fracture site. At the four-month check-up, a CT scan revealed a lack of healing at the fracture site and knee joint stiffness with a rigid stop at 30o flexion. After removal of the external fixator at 18 weeks, the patient was reoperated on a scheduled basis, under intradural regional anaesthesia and sedation, for refreshing of the fracture site and internal fixation by means of retrograde femoral endomedullary nailing using a T2 nail (Stryker®), and for treatment of the knee extension contracture, a modified Judet technique quadriceplasty was performed, after which a gain in joint balance was observed, flexing the knee against gravity to 110o.  The immediate postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient began early rehabilitation treatment programmed by the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service of the HCDGU. In the controls after surgery, the patient presented a knee joint balance of 110o of flexion with full extension, with normal gait and without pain. At present, the patient is fully reincorporated to his usual activities.   "
"This is a 16-year-old adolescent, a competitive basketball player since the age of 5, who went to the Andalusian Centre for Sports Medicine (CAMD) in Almeria to undergo a medical examination requested by his Federation. In the anamnesis, he reported episodes of palpitations, short and self-limited, during rest and exertion. The resting ECG showed a very short interval between P and R waves (PR interval) with a delta wave, compatible with pre-excitation, for which he was referred for cardiological assessment. His personal history included a previous evaluation at the age of 9 years, in an asymptomatic patient, with a normal ECG and the reference of a paternal uncle, affected with a recently ablated arrhythmia. A new resting ECG confirmed a pre-excited sinus rhythm, compatible with right anteroseptal pathway and structural heart disease was ruled out by echocardiography. The 24-hour rhythm holter showed permanent pre-excitation and no arrhythmias. The treadmill stress test with Bruce protocol was conclusive and free of arrhythmias, maintaining the WPW at maximum heart rates.  Considering the previous data and his condition as a competitive athlete, he was sent for electrophysiological study (EPS) and ablation of the anomalous pathway. The procedure was performed with two electrocatheters: one for diagnosis with His recording and the other for mapping and ablation in the perihisian septal region. In sinus rhythm, orthodromic tachycardia was induced and radiofrequency (RF) was applied over the bidirectional atrioventricular (AV) accessory pathway. Tachycardia and pre-excitation were interrupted, terminating the procedure. The patient was left with right bundle branch block (RBBB), probably of traumatic origin. There is no description of the effective refractory period of the anomalous pathway. At the first subsequent follow-up, the patient reported the same clinical manifestations prior to ablation and management to interrupt the tachycardias. The baseline ECG and 24-hour holter maintain the sinus pattern with WPW, with no documented tachycardias. The parents have been asked to consult the electrophysiology specialist again in order to offer the best treatment options in relation to sports practice.   "
"A 34-year-old man consulted for pain with paraesthesia on the ulnar border of the right hand and fourth and fifth fingers for two weeks after a tennis tournament. He presented diffuse oedema in the volar aspect of the ulnar area of the wrist and hand, with positive Tinnel over the pisiform. Radiology and ultrasound were normal. After infiltration of a corticoid with local anaesthetic, he was immobilised with a wrist brace in neutral position. The neurophysiological study showed a compressive neuropathy of the ulnar nerve in Guyon's canal. The patient received symptomatic treatment with cryotherapy, orthosis, analgesics, vitamin B complex and physiotherapy. Computerised Axial Tomography (CAT) of the wrist, requested due to persistent pain at nine months, showed a pseudarthrosis of the unciform process of the hooked bone, with a large fragment. He underwent surgery by palmar approach, dissection of the ulnar neurovascular bundle, cross-linking of the pseudarthrosis bed and osteosynthesis with two 1.5mm diameter Compact Hand titanium screws (Synhes®).  He maintained an antebrachial splint, including the fingers, for three weeks, after which he began physiotherapy. Four months after surgery, the patient was symptom-free, except for hypoaesthesia of the fourth finger, with full mobility, recovered strength and returned to work (strength) and sporting activities. The CT scan at two months and the X-ray at three months showed a partial fusion. A new CT scan at four months showed complete union.  "
"Male patient referred in 2009 for monitoring to the Bone Metabolic Unit (BMU) at the age of 36 and diagnosed in a private centre with monostotic Paget's disease of the left radius. At the time, the patient provided a biopsy and scintigraphy report carried out in 2007. He was treated with risedronate at the dose used for osteoporosis. On observing the good result in the levels of P1NP (procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide), risedronate was discontinued that same year, 2009. From then until November 2014, he was periodically monitored for serum levels of bone remodelling markers, and a new cycle of low-dose risedronate was prescribed for a few months when these increased. Also during this period of time, a scan was performed without finding any significant alterations with respect to the previous scan. When the treatment was administered, the patient's symptoms of local pain improved, but in November 2014 he spontaneously came to the clinic with his arm in a sling, reporting that two days earlier he had suffered a casual fall and presented intense pain in the area of the left carpus. Physical examination revealed a haematoma on the dorsum of the hand and distal third of the forearm, oedema, effacement of the tendon grooves on the dorsum of the hand, functional impotence of the wrist and a local increase in temperature. Given the clinical suspicion of fracture, the patient was referred from the Metabolic Unit to the Accident and Emergency Department where X-rays were taken; he was discharged with the diagnosis of contusion as no fracture was evident, but a large hyperostotic lesion was observed on plain X-rays, which is why the patient returned to the BMU. Despite the fact that the fracture was not visible on the X-rays, but there was clinical evidence of it, an urgent computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan and a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scan were requested for a deferred study of the hyperostotic lesion. The CT scan showed a fracture of the hooked and trapezius bones. The limb was immobilised with a posterior splint. Once the traumatic emergency had been resolved, the radiological lesion of the radius was re-evaluated in the following days and the so-called ""sliding wax melting"" sign was identified. Given the possibility of melorheostosis, this option was discussed with the Radiology and Nuclear Medicine departments for their consideration. Finally, this was accepted as an alternative diagnosis to Paget's disease of bone, being indistinguishable gammagraphically. Once the new diagnosis of melorheostosis had been confirmed and agreed, we went back to the anamnesis, which included a report of a fall at the age of 14 while practising sport. The patient reported having suffered intense pain in the radius, but did not go to any health centre and hid it from his parents, presenting a certain deformity since then. The pain subsided weeks after the fall. We deduce that the patient fractured his radius and as the fracture was not immobilised or reduced, he was left with the deformity that can be seen in figure 1, but which is not directly related to the hyperostosis. In addition to the striking central image, there are other areas of hyperostosis on the inside of the distal end of the radius and in the proximal third.   "
"We describe the case of a 47-year-old patient being followed up for psoriatic spondyloarthritis and fibromyalgia, on treatment with leflunomide, celecoxib and gabapentin, with no history of interest and with regular menstrual cycles. She reported no toxic habits and her body mass index (BMI) was normal. During a routine check-up, she reported pain in her feet and ankles, with no history of trauma, of a mechanical rhythm, which progressively increased until it caused claudication on walking, with modification of the statics of her feet due to the pain. On examination, there was swelling of the ankles and feet, with pain on pressure and bilateral fovea. An ultrasound scan was performed in consultation, which revealed very marked inflammation of the subcutaneous cellular tissue (TCS) with no signs of synovitis or Doppler signal. A foot X-ray was requested, which showed no pathological findings. Due to the significant SCT oedema, the patient was referred to Angiology for assessment. Angiology requested a lymphography scan which confirmed severe bilateral lymphatic insufficiency. As the clinical manifestations of intense pain with claudication persisted, an MRI of the feet was ordered, which showed a fracture callus in the right foot in the 3rd and 4th MTT and oedema in the 2nd MTT; and in the left foot a fracture line in the 1st MTT, and oedema in the 3rd and 4th MTT and in the surrounding tissue. Given the findings of the MRI, the patient was assessed by the Traumatology Department, which indicated conservative treatment with unloading and rehabilitation (magnetotherapy). Due to the finding of multiple stress fractures, a study was carried out in our consulting rooms, and analyses were performed with renal function, serum and urinary calcium, ionic calcium, magnesium and PTH, which were normal. Only a vitamin D level of 19.5 ng/ml was found, and supplementation was indicated.  Assessing the case of this patient as a whole, we considered, as a predisposing factor for the appearance of stress fractures, the significant alteration of the antalgic foot statics that she had developed due to the pain caused by the severe lymphatic insufficiency that she suffered.   "
"A 65-year-old male patient diagnosed with OI following a study of a daughter who was also affected. He had no previous family history of the disease.  He reported a history of several fractures (approximately 6-7) during childhood and adolescence following minimal trauma, the first of the humerus at the age of 2 years. During adulthood he had had two new fractures in the elbow and shoulder. All had been treated conservatively. He received calcium treatment during childhood. He had also had multiple sprains and several muscle ruptures throughout his life. Diagnosed with otosclerosis, he had undergone surgery for stapedectomy of both ears. He was referred to our clinic for osteoporosis detected in bone densitometry (DXA), which showed T-scores of -3.4 in the lumbar spine (L1-L4), -3 in the femoral neck and -2.8 in the total femur. He was asymptomatic. Physical examination revealed a height of 162 cm, blue sclerae and the presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta. There were no thoracic deformities, nor in the dorsolumbar spine or limbs, except for the right elbow (postfracture). No hyperlaxity was observed. The calcium-phosphorus metabolism study showed normal levels of calcium, phosphorus, calciuria, and parathormone (iPTH). 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHCC) levels were in the range of insufficiency: 22 ng/ml (desirable values >30 ng/ml). Bone remodelling markers were in the normal range. Other endocrine causes of osteoporosis were ruled out. As part of our protocol for the study of patients with OI, a cervical spine X-ray ruled out basilar impression, and a chest X-ray showed degenerative changes in the spine; the echocardiogram showed minimal dilatation of the ascending aorta; respiratory function tests were normal, and the abdominal ultrasound ruled out renal lithiasis. A genetic study was performed by massive sequencing by NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) of the COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP and LEPRE1 genes, detecting a heterozygous deletion of a Guanine (c.3524delG) in the COL1A1 gene. This mutation results in a change in the reading pattern, which, at the level of the collagen protein, causes a premature stop codon (p.Gly1175Valfs*64) and is therefore likely to be a pathogenic change. Other changes were detected and considered polymorphisms. Treatment with weekly alendronate associated with daily calcium and vitamin D supplements was recommended, showing a discrete densitometric improvement after 1 year of treatment (T-scores of -3.2 in the lumbar spine, -2.9 in the femoral neck and -2.4 in the total femur).   "
"72-year-old man on HD programme since December 2002, due to renal failure secondary to bilateral nephrectomy for renal neoplasia (1999 and 2002). History of arterial hypertension, appendicectomy, cholecystectomy and right inguinal herniorrhaphy. Splenectomy for spleen injury during right nephrectomy (2002). Venous thrombosis in the right lower limb due to femoral cannulation (dialysis catheter). Ischaemic colitis, colon polyposis and lower gastrointestinal bleeding in 2007. In December 2008 a new episode of lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to angiodysplasia. Diagnosed in 2009 with moderate-severe aortic stenosis. History of vascular access: - Started treatment in December-02 via a right femoral catheter. It was withdrawn in February 2003 (venous thrombosis). - A left humero-cephalic AVF was performed in January 2003. It was started at 4 weeks. It developed an aneurysmal dilatation, presenting partial thrombosis (December 2003), which allowed its use in unipuncture. - In December 2003, a right humero-basilic AVF was performed, which did not work. - In the same month a right humero-axillary PTFE graft was implanted, with thrombosis after 24 hours. It had to be removed due to infection in January 2004. - Due to dysfunction of the left fistula, a tunneled catheter was implanted in the left internal jugular vein in January 2004. It was used as a VA until July 2004, and was removed due to infection refractory to antibiotic therapy. - On 22-7-04 there was an unsuccessful attempt to cannulate the right internal jugular vein, and a catheter was placed in the right femoral vein: it was removed in Sep-04, as a functioning AVF was available. - Again, on 23-7-04, unsuccessful attempts were made to cannulate both the right and left internal jugular veins. - On 4-8-04 a PTFE prosthesis was implanted between the left femoral artery and vein. It was used from September until 22-10-04 (non-recoverable thrombosis). - On the same day 22-10-04 a tunneled catheter was implanted in the right internal jugular vein: - In October 2005 he presented an episode of bacteraemia due to E. coli, resolved with antibiotherapy. - Subsequently, the catheter gave problems of insufficient flow, frequently requiring both local and systemic fibrinolytic treatment. - For this reason, in November 2006, anticoagulation with acenocoumarol (Sintrom®) was indicated, with slight functional improvement. - In February 2007 she suffered an episode of lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, due to ischaemic colitis and colon polyps and conditioned by the anticoagulant treatment. - After withdrawal of acenocoumarol the catheter stopped giving flow. - On 22-2-07 an attempt was made to replace the catheter via the same venous line, but it was impossible to insert the new catheter due to complete thrombosis of the superior cava. - On the same day, 22-2-07, a temporary catheter was placed in the left femoral vein. It was removed on 2-3-07 as a functioning central catheter was available. - On 28-2-07 a Split-Cath tunneled catheter was placed directly in the right atrium, by means of a right anterior mini-thoracotomy. - From the first dialysis session, there was minimal blood leakage through the junction of the catheter with the connection extensions. This did not prevent her from continuing to use the catheter. - Hospitalisation in October 2007 due to catheter infection, resolved with antibiotic therapy. - In November 2007 the blood leakage increased significantly and was resolved by sealing with sterile silicone and placing a PTFE sheath around the leakage point. - In March 09, the blood leakage was again present, resolved with the same sealing procedure and PTFE sheath. - On 30-11-09 it leaked again, and a new sealing attempt failed. - On 22-3-09 he required the insertion of a temporary catheter in the right femoral artery for a few days. - On 17-12-09 a new transthoracic replacement was performed by thoracotomy, and another Split-Cath catheter was inserted. - As a complication, he developed post-surgery cardiogenic shock, and was diagnosed with moderate-severe aortic valve stenosis. - The catheter gave inadequate flow, and it was shown that the distal ends were located in the suprahepatic vein. - On 25-3-10 the catheter was repositioned in haemodynamics, the distal ends of the catheter being located in the inferior vena cava. - On 24-9-10, again due to catheter dysfunction, the catheter was repositioned in haemodynamics, the distal ends remaining lodged in the right atrium. - On 22-3-10 he required the insertion of a temporary catheter in the right femoral artery for a few days. Since the last episode on 24-9-10 and until today (10-02-2012), the patient has been dialysed at his dialysis centre via the transthoracic catheter, with no incidents and with adequate catheter function.

"73-year-old woman with a personal history of hypertensive heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, type II diabetes, hysterectomy for uterine prolapse and correction of cystocele, primary hypothyroidism, trigeminal neuralgia, bronchial asthma, depression, arteriosclerosis, cholecystectomy for gallbladder adenomyoma, adrenal insufficiency and bilateral nephrectomy: right due to pseudotumour and left due to abcessed haematoma, which has led her to remain on renal replacement therapy with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) since January 2011. During the training period and in subsequent consultations, there was no evidence of poor performance of the technique by the patient, nor did she report symptoms of pneumoperitoneum. In March 2013, she came to the emergency department with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea without vomiting and chills without fever. Physical examination in the emergency department revealed pain on palpation, predominantly in the right iliac fossa, skin pallor and limbs without oedema. BP: 100/60, Fc: 94 bpm, afebrile, Fr: 24 rpm, Sat.O2:89%. Laboratory tests were performed (haemogram, biochemistry and venous blood gases), chest and abdominal X-ray showing a well-placed peritoneal dialysis catheter and pneumoperitoneum. After being assessed by the surgery department, a CT scan with oral contrast showed a significant pneumoperitoneum, with no contrast leakage or perforation of a hollow viscera.  Once the initial nursing assessment had been carried out, with the above data and the patient interview, no problems were observed with the technique. We proceeded to perform a peritoneal dialysis exchange according to protocol, to assess the possibility of peritoneal infection. No signs of infection were observed (clear peritoneal fluid), a sample of fluid was collected for culture and analysis, with the result: leukocytes: 80/uL, thus ruling out peritoneal infection. Given the patient's condition, she was admitted for observation. She was placed on an absolute diet and serum therapy. Given the possibility that the pneumoperitoneum was related to the peritoneal dialysis technique, it was decided that the nursing staff would perform the peritoneal dialysis exchanges according to the guidelines and, after drainage, place the patient in the Trendelemburg position to encourage peritoneal air to escape. Subsequent radiological studies show a gradual decrease in the pneumoperitoneum, which is almost completely resolved by the time the patient is discharged from the hospital.   "
"A 57-year-old man with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with ischaemic heart disease and acute inferior myocardial infarction in 2004, peripheral artery disease with bifemoral aortic bypass in 2006, and acute ischaemia of the left lower limb in 2010 due to by-pass occlusion requiring urgent revascularisation with thrombectomy. He has been on haemodialysis since December 2010 due to chronic renal failure possibly secondary to nephroangiosclerosis. After failure of the left radiocephalic AVF, a left jugular temporal catheter was placed at the end of August 2013, which was dysfunctional from the beginning but was maintained until the use of a new left humerus cephalic AVF. One month after catheter placement, the patient occasionally reported postural low back pain to the nurse, although the patient himself attributed this to exertion. After removal of the catheter (43 days after insertion), in several subsequent sessions he presented general malaise and fever, a bacteriological control of the monitor was carried out, which was negative, and vancomycin 1 g was administered empirically, together with an antipyretic, and the patient remained stable for the following month. Subsequently, he again reported very intense lumbar pain that barely allowed him to ambulate. He went to the emergency department on up to four occasions and after examination, X-ray and abdominal ultrasound always diagnosed mechanical lumbago. Given the deterioration of his general condition and after confirming analytical alterations (increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), he was admitted to the internal medicine unit for further investigation. Following positive microbiological results for S. aureus, antibiotic treatment with cloxacillin was started. Following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a diagnosis of spondylodiscitis D10-D11 was made, associated with a paravertebral abscess that did not involve nerve structures. Analgesic treatment was started with first level drugs associated with transdermal opioids, with progressive titration of doses throughout the hospital stay and acceptable pain control. The patient remained afebrile throughout his admission, with a progressive decrease in acute phase reactants and negative blood cultures. He completed five weeks of targeted intravenous antibiotic treatment and was then transferred to outpatient oral therapy and discharged from hospital. At this time the patient remains stable without further intrahaemodialysis symptoms with analgesia controlled by the patient and awaiting new control MRI.   "
"Patient aged 70 years, retired miner, with no known drug allergies, with a personal history: old work accident with vertebral and rib fractures; operated on for Dupuytren's disease in the right hand and left iliofemoral by-pass; Diabetes Mellitus type II, hypercholesterolemia and hyperuricaemia; active alcoholism, smoker of 20 cigarettes/day. He was referred from primary care because he presented postvoid macroscopic haematuria on one occasion and persistent microhaematuria afterwards, with normal micturition. Physical examination showed a good general condition, with normal abdomen and genitalia; rectal examination was compatible with grade I/IV prostate adenoma. Urinalysis showed 4 red blood cells/field and 0-5 leukocytes/field; the rest of the sediment was normal. Normal haemogram; biochemistry showed glycaemia of 169 mg/dl and triglycerides of 456 mg/dl; liver and kidney function was normal. PSA of 1.16 ng/ml. Urine cytology was repeatedly suspicious for malignancy. Simple abdominal X-ray shows degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and vascular calcifications in both hypochondrium and pelvis. Urological ultrasound revealed the existence of simple cortical cysts in the right kidney, bladder without alterations with good capacity and prostate weighing 30g. The IVUS showed bilateral renal normofunctionalism, calcifications on the right renal silhouette and arthrosed ureters with addition images in the upper third of both ureters, related to ureteral pseudodiverticulosis. The cystogram shows a bladder with good capacity, but trabeculated walls in relation to stress bladder. Abdominal CT scan is normal.  Cystoscopy revealed the existence of small bladder tumours, and transurethral resection was performed with the anatomopathological result of superficial urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.  "
"We describe the case of a 37-year-old man with a previous active life who reported osteoarticular pain of variable location in the last month and fever in the last week with peaks (morning and evening) of 40 C in the last 24-48 hours, for which he went to the Emergency Department. Before the onset of the symptoms, he had been in Extremadura in a brucella-endemic region, eating unpasteurised goat's milk and cheese from such cattle. Several cases of brucellosis were found among the diners. During admission for the study of the febrile syndrome with epidemiological antecedents of possible exposure to Brucella, the patient presented a picture of right orchiepididymitis. Physical examination revealed: temperature 40.2°C; T.A: 109/68 mmHg; Fc: 105 bpm. He was conscious, oriented, sweating, eupneic, with good nutritional and hydration status. No palpable head and neck lymph nodes, no goitre or jugular vein engorgement, with symmetrical carotid pulses. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, without murmurs, friction or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation with preservation of vesicular murmur. Abdomen soft, depressible, without masses or megaliths. In the neurological examination, no meningeal signs or signs of focality were detected. Extremities without varicose veins or oedema. Peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. The urological examination revealed an enlarged right teste, not adhered to the skin, with areas of fluctuation and intensely painful on palpation, with loss of the epididymo-testicular boundary and positive transillumination. The analytical data showed the following results: haemogram: Hb 13.7 g/dl; leucocytes 14,610/mm3 (neutrophils 77%); platelets 206,000/mm3. ESR: 40 mm 1 hour. Coagulation: TQ 87%; TTPA 25.8 sec. Biochemistry: glucose 117 mg/dl; urea 29 mg/dl; creatinine 0.9 mg/dl; sodium 136 mEq/l; potassium 3.6 mEq/l; GOT 11 U/l; GPT 24 U/l; GGT 34 U/l; alkaline phosphatase 136 U/l; calcium 8.3 mg/dl. Urine: sediment normal. During admission, blood cultures were requested: positive for Brucella and specific serology for Brucella: Rose Bengal +++; Coombs test > 1/1280; Brucellacapt > 1/5120. The imaging tests requested (chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, cranial CT scan, transthoracic echocardiogram) showed no significant pathology, except for the testicular ultrasound, which showed thickening of the scrotal sac with a small amount of fluid with septa and an enlarged testicle with small hypoechoic areas inside that may represent microabscesses. With the diagnosis of orchiepididymitis secondary to Brucella, symptomatic treatment (antipyretics, anti-inflammatory drugs, rest and testicular elevation) and specific antibiotic treatment was started: Doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 hours (for 6 weeks) and Streptomycin 1 gram intramuscularly every 24 hours (for 3 weeks). The patient's condition improved significantly after one week of hospitalisation, and he was discharged home, where he completed the antibiotic treatment regimen. Subsequent visits to the clinic showed complete remission of the symptoms.  "
"This is a 29-year-old woman who underwent a follow-up pelvic ultrasound examination after laparoscopic tubal ligation. During the study, a 20 mm tumour was detected on the right lateral aspect of the bladder, well defined and hypoechoic. The patient had no micturition symptoms, as she mentioned in the subsequent interrogation.  Intravenous urography was performed, which did not detect any alteration of the upper urinary tract. The cystogram showed a rounded, smooth-surfaced repletion defect located in the right bladder wall. Blood and urine tests were within normal limits. The patient underwent cystoscopy, which revealed the presence of a ""hump-shaped"" tumour with a smooth surface and preserved mucosa on the right lateral aspect of the bladder, immediately above and in front of the ipsilateral ureteral meatus.  With the presumptive diagnosis of bladder leiomyoma, transurethral resection of the tumour was performed. The resected fragments had a whitish, solid and compact appearance, similar to that of a prostatic adenoma, with little bleeding. The material obtained from the transurethral resection consisted of a proliferation of spindle cells with elongated cytoplasm, like the nucleus, and slightly eosinophilic. No mitoses or atypia were observed. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for muscle-specific actin (DAKO, clone HHF35 ) in the proliferating cells.  Three months after transurethral resection, a control cystoscopy was performed, showing a raised calcareous plaque over the area of previous resection, compatible with encrusting cystopathy, which was treated by transurethral resection of this and leiomyomatous debris and subsequent urinary acidification.  "
"A seventeen year old male with no previous history of interest presented with pollakiuria, urinary itching, urgency and self-limited haematuria. Urine analysis showed 30-50 red blood cells per field. Urine culture was negative. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing a small lesion measuring half a centimetre in diameter, solid with anterior hyperechogenic enhancement.  Cystoscopy was performed and two small raised lesions were observed on the right side, outside the ureteral orifice, with apparently normal mucosa, similar to two igloos. Suspecting an inflammatory lesion, treatment with A.I.N.E. was prescribed for ten days without the lesions disappearing, and surgical intervention was decided. TUR of both bladder lesions was performed, and the anatomopathological report was that of bladder leiomyoma, describing the lesion as a ""proliferation of spindle cells arranged in intertwined fascicles with blunt nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm without atypia, necrosis or significant mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry showed intense diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for smooth muscle actin.  No recurrence of these lesions has been observed in the patient's follow-up.  "
"A 36-year-old man, with no past history of interest, was seen in the internal medicine department for presenting a painful left inguinoscrotal mass on palpation of two months' duration, without weight loss or micturition syndrome. On examination, the testicles were of normal size and consistency, with an indurated and very painful left spermatic cord. Testicular ultrasound was normal. Abdomen-pelvis CT scan revealed a mass measuring 6 x 3 centimetres in the trajectory of the left spermatic cord, with no evidence of retroperitoneal involvement. With the diagnosis of a left paratesticular tumour, he underwent surgery, a mass was found in the spermatic cord and an intraoperative biopsy was performed, which was reported as a neoplastic proliferation of non-lymphomatous myofibroblastic appearance, for which a radical left orchiectomy was performed. Pathology was pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma of the spermatic cord, normal testis and epididymis and negative resection margins.  Subsequently, the patient received several cycles of chemotherapy with adriamycin and ifosfamide + MESNA. In the control imaging tests four months after surgery, no tumour recurrence was observed.  "
"A 29-year-old woman with a history of duodenal ulcus and constipation consulted for pain in the right renal fossa compatible with renoureteral crisis. No history of nephrolithiasis, haematuria or urinary tract infections. Examination revealed only a positive right renal fist percussion. Ultrasound showed right renal pyelocaliceal ectasia with parenchymal thinning. IVUS shows a functional annulment of the right renal unit, the rest of the examination being normal. Retrograde pyelography showed stenosis at the right pyeloureteral junction, with negative selective urine cytology of the right ureter. Faced with the dilemma of whether to perform reconstructive surgery or exeresis, renal scintigraphy was performed, showing a relative uptake of 33% for the right kidney and 67% for the left kidney.  Right renal pyeloplasty was performed according to the Anderson-Hynes technique. Pathological examination of the urinary tract stenosis revealed a cavernous haemangioma as the cause of the obstruction, which did not allow any cannula to pass. Postoperative urographic control at 3 months showed uptake and elimination of contrast in the right kidney with a slight delay compared to the left kidney.  The patient was discharged from the outpatient clinic three years after surgery after two more urographic controls; 7 years after pyeloplasty she has not consulted again for urological symptoms.  "
"Male, 58 years old at the time of transplantation on 5 October 1998. On peritoneal dialysis since January of the same year due to progressive CKD secondary to IgA glomerulonephritis with associated focal and segmental sclerosis diagnosed in 1984. Other antecedents of interest: arterial hypertension diagnosed in 1982, under pharmacological treatment, ischaemic heart disease due to coronary artery disease with transluminal angioplasty of the right coronary artery in 1994 (since then asymptomatic, subsequent stress tests negative), type II dyslipidaemia. He underwent surgery for bilateral cryptorchidism and tonsillectomy in his youth. Renal transplant was uneventful (left kidney in right iliac fossa with 2 arteries in single patch and vein leading to external iliac), with immediate effective graft function, no acute rejection and high levels of cyclosporine with no apparent clinical toxicity. The patient received treatment with cyclosporine 8mg/kg, mycophenolate mofetil 2g/day, and prednisone 1mg/kg, with figures progressively decreasing in subsequent controls. In September 2000 (2 years after the transplant), the patient reported for the first time a feeling of instability when walking and trembling in his hands, which progressively increased, and a study was started by the neurology department. At the time of the study, the patient had gait instability, paraesthesia in both lower limbs (lower extremities) and hand tremors. Physical examination showed no motor deficit but decreased vibration sensitivity in both LES, vivid osteotendinous reflexes (OTR) and cutaneoplantar reflex (CPR) in extension. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no lesions at cerebral or spinal level, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without oligoclonal bands, evoked potentials were altered at tibial level and serological tests, ELISA, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were positive for HTLV-I in CSF and blood in the first case and PCR in blood. A high viral load was demonstrated. The patient was diagnosed with tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), and despite repeated pulses of 6-Methyl-Prednisolone, he is progressively evolving. He has refused treatment with interferon due to the possibility of transplant rejection, and his renal function has always been correct, with creatinine levels oscillating between 1-1-2. He was studied by our department due to urinary urgency with occasional leakage and dribbling. A radiographic and urodynamic study confirmed the existence of a hyperrefléxic bladder and a large bladder lithiasis which was removed by cystolithotomy without postoperative incidents in December 2003. The patient is currently dependent for basic functions of daily life such as toileting, ambulation (he moves around in a wheelchair), feeding (he is not able to hold a spoon).  "
"42-year-old woman at the time of undergoing a liver transplant. Her personal history prior to the transplant included appendectomy in 1978, liver cirrhosis of probable alcoholic origin diagnosed in 1989, ADH secondary to grade II oesophageal varices in 1996 together with portal hypertension and ascites. In February 1998 she was diagnosed with hepatocarcinoma. The patient received an uneventful liver transplant in October 1998 and was discharged on treatment with tacrolimus. Eighteen months after the transplant, the patient reported for the first time weakness of the lower limbs and loss of sensation in them, evolving within two months to complete paraplegia affecting the urinary bladder. Physical examination revealed paraparesis with amyotrophy due to disuse of the lower limbs, greater subjective hypoaesthesia in DID with level D8-D10, more intense deep sensory impairment in DID, especially at the vibratory level. ROT present, the patellar ones alive and the Achilles hypoactive. Bilateral extensor CPR. The following diagnostic tests were also performed in this case: Brain MRI: involvement of the medullary cord from C2 to D10, also presenting hyperintense supratentorial lacunar lesions mainly at the subcortical level of the left frontal lobe and also the right frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. PEES: pathological at posterior tibial level CSF: sexological determination for HTLV-I positive, rest normal. Blood test for antibodies (ELISA) and for the existence of the virus (HTLV-I), positive. The patient was diagnosed with tropical spastic paraparesis and treated with Interferon-á, initially presenting discreet improvement, especially at the distal level of the EEII, although in the last few days the treatment regimen had to be reduced due to an increase in transaminase values. Despite the initial good response, the symptoms have progressively worsened and she is now dependent for daily life and has a permanent bladder catheter after an attempt at bladder re-education by intermittent catheterisation failed. The liver transplant is currently functioning. In all three cases, transplantectomy was not indicated given the spread of the virus to the blood and nervous systems and the impossibility, given the measures available, of eradicating it and the good function of the transplanted organs.  "
"A 65-year-old man consulted for an infravesical obstructive syndrome together with a soft tumour in the right hemiscrotal, which decreased in size during urination. Physical examination revealed the presence of an enlarged right scrotal pouch and a reducible inguinal hernia. Rectal examination revealed a medium-sized, bilobed, adenomatous prostate. The complementary examinations included a total PSA, which was normal, a vesico-prostatic ultrasound that revealed a 57-gram prostate and a testicular ultrasound with an image suggestive of vesical herniation.  Finally, retrograde cystography showed the presence of a massive bladder hernia in the right hemiscrotal.  Treatment was surgical and consisted of resection of the herniated portion of the bladder which was peritoneal and correction of the inguinal hernia with marlex mesh. In a second stage a TUR of the prostate was performed. Controlled after six months the patient remains asymptomatic.  "
"Patient with a history of hiatal hernia and two caesarean sections at 22 and 24 years of age. At 31 years of age, she consulted because since the second caesarean section and with increasing intensity, she complained of micturition syndrome, accompanied by pelvic and perineal pain, in the days before, during and after menstruation. She reported no haematuria or fever. Examination of the external genitalia and abdomen showed no abnormalities. She was treated on multiple occasions with urinary antiseptics, although positive urocultures were never demonstrated. The renal ultrasound was normal and the bladder showed a 1.5 cm hyperechogenic, excremental image on the posterior aspect of the bladder. Cystoscopy was performed in the middle of the menstrual cycle, describing the existence of a small area, minimally raised, blurred, retrotrigonal, which on contact with the cystoscope produced faint ecchymosis, not being identified at that time as the image of endometriosis. The patient was lost for check-ups for 3 years, during which time she continued with the same symptoms, and was treated by her gynaecologist who performed diagnostic laparoscopy, finding no pelvic endometriotic foci, but an adhesion to the pelvic walls and bladder in solidarity with the uterine body. The patient returned to our department and underwent an ultrasound and CT scan. Abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound showed an echogenic formation in the bladder floor 2 x 1.5x2.7.  An abdominopelvic CT scan showed no pathology in the abdominal organs, but in the bladder there was a mass measuring 2x3 cm on the posterior side with no clear differentiation plane with the uterus.  At the age of 34 and with the suspicion of possible endometriosis, bladder endoscopy was performed under anaesthesia a few days before menstruation, and a morular mass of about 3 cm, retrotrigonal, with somewhat oedematous mucosa, intact and with areas of bluish colour was observed. TUR was performed, showing small cavities when sectioned with the snare, which corresponded to cystified endometrial glands, from which retained blood in the form of blackish fluid flowed when cut. The histopathological study confirmed the presence of intramuscular nests of endometrial-type glands, surrounded by oedematous endometrial stroma, with no signs of malignancy; all compatible with the diagnosis of endometriosis.  The patient was treated for 6 months with LH-RH analogues. Five years later she is completely asymptomatic and has had several bladder ultrasound scans and two cystoscopies during this period with no evidence of recurrence.  "
"A 22-year-old male patient, with no history of interest apart from being a regular smoker of marijuana, came to the emergency department reporting enlargement of the left scrotal sac after physical exertion 24 hours earlier, with pain of sudden onset and moderate intensity. No fever or micturition syndrome, nor irradiation of the pain. There was no associated neurovegetative cortex or alterations in bowel rhythm. On physical examination he was apyretic and normotensive, with good skin and mucous membrane colouring. The abdomen is soft and depressible, non-painful and without masses. The renal fossae are free. The right testicle showed no alterations while in the left testicle there was a stony tumour 2-3cm in diameter, non-mobile, in the upper pole of the left testicle, with negative transillumination. Laboratory tests showed no abnormal parameters. In the testicular ultrasound, both testicles showed a normal echostructure with preserved Doppler flow, showing an extratesticular solid mass, in contact with the upper pole of the left teste of 25mm with vessels in its periphery. The patient was admitted to complete the study and identify the lesion. Following the oncological protocol, the preoperative staging was completed with chest X-ray, testicular tumour markers and general analyses, and abdominal-pelvic CT scan without finding any pathological alterations in any of the tests. A surgical exploration was then performed via the inguinal route where a slightly dented left paratesticular mass with smooth curves, pearly and stony in consistency, easy to dissect with a cleavage plane between it and the upper pole of the left testicle and spermatic cord on the same side, with some venous vessels in its periphery, was observed. A perioperative biopsy was taken which showed fibrous tissue with no malignant cellularity. The lesion was excised, leaving the teste and epididymis intact, sparing the patient a radical orchiectomy. With an uneventful postoperative period, he was discharged two days after the operation. The anatomopathological report of the surgical specimen was a solitary fibrous tumour of the tunica vaginalis.  In the postoperative control two years after the operation, the patient is asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence and free of disease.   "
"A 46 year old woman, hysterectomised for leiomyomas, came to the emergency department for intense pain in the left renal fossa, general malaise and repeated episodes of haematuria. Several urine cytological studies were negative for neoplastic cells. Imaging studies led to the patient's surgical intervention, which revealed an atrophic left kidney and a large 'tumour mass' encompassing the theoretical exit of the left internal iliac artery, left ureter, pouch of Douglas, rectum and lateral peritoneal surface. Due to the technical difficulties involved in enucleating such a lesion, a ureteral sample was taken and submitted for histopathological diagnosis with the suspicion of ureteral carcinoma. The macroscopic study of the referred material showed an irregular whitish tissue with an elastic-firm consistency and fibrous appearance, which on serial sections showed a fine reddish stippling that was difficult to appreciate. Histological examination revealed a ureteral segment with multiple intramuscular dilated glandular structures lined by endometrial epithelium whose immunohistochemical staining was strongly positive for cytokeratins, oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors. Enveloping the ureteral wall was abundant disordered fibrous tissue with signs of haemorrhage. With all these data, the diagnosis of intrinsic ureteral endometriosis was made, although the intense extra-ureteral tissue response and the clear signs of haemorrhage that accompanied it led us to think of an accompanying extrinsic component, although no glandular structures were identified at that level.   "
"A 36-year-old man, with no personal history of interest, who in an ultrasound scan performed due to colicky pain over the right renal fossa, was reported as an intrarenal mass measuring 8-10 cm with echogenic material inside, located in the lower pole of the right kidney, suggesting a complicated renal cyst. Subsequent CT scan showed a solid mass in the lower pole of the right kidney with a maximum diameter of 10 cm, which caused compression of the excretory tract, with no evidence of tumour thrombus in the renal vein or in the cava, suggestive of hypernephroma. Bone scintigraphy with Tc99m-MDP was performed and no pathological bone accumulations were observed.  Based on the data obtained, a radical right nephrectomy was performed, revealing an intraoperative finding of a mass attached to the lower pole of the right kidney (the tumour and the kidney, although close together, were clearly independent on dissection). The anatomo-pathological report of the specimen was a solitary fibrous tumour. The tumour was well demarcated but not encapsulated, without infiltrating the kidney or the renal vessels which were displaced by the large tumour mass. The immunohistochemical study showed positivity for CD34, CD99 and Vimentin, while it was negative for Desmin, Protein S-100, and CAM5.2.  The patient underwent surgery in November 2001. Since then, he has been undergoing outpatient controls in our clinic with biannual ultrasound scans and annual CT scans, with no recurrence.   "
"A 50-year-old patient with a history of recurrent renal lithiasis consulted for recurrent haematuria and a feeling of discomfort. Serial cytological examination of urine showed the presence of atypical cells suspicious for malignancy. Imaging studies revealed a heterogeneous lesion occupying almost the entire right renal pelvis. Total nephrectomy and partial ureterectomy were performed, revealing a kidney measuring a maximum of 10.5 x 5 cm with an irregular, heterogeneous brownish lesion in the renal pelvis with haemorrhagic areas and other slightly yellowish, shiny areas with an extremely soft consistency when cut. This lesion, relatively well delimited, did not invade the renal parenchyma or the renal sinus and was limited to the pyelocaliceal system, although it compressed the cortex with expansive margins at one of the renal poles. Histological examination showed that the lesion consisted of well-demarcated tumour nests with no evidence of invasion of the renal parenchyma, encompassing a central mucinous matrix which constituted more than 50% of the tumour volume. Loose neoplastic cells and nests of smaller size than those located at the peripheral level were found floating within this matrix. The tumour cells showed polygonal morphology with central nuclei without apparent nucleoli and little atypia as well as eosinophilic and clear cytoplasm. In the areas bordering the mucinous matrix, a shy glandular differentiation was observed, coinciding with the observation of some nucleoli and a slight increase in nuclear atypia. The tumour cells showed intense immunopositivity for EMA, CK 7 and mild immunopositivity for CK20; this, together with the morphology, confirmed the urothelial nature of the neoplasm. With all the above data, the diagnosis of low-grade transitional cell carcinoma with intense mucinous differentiation of the renal pelvis (colloid carcinoma) was made.   "
"A 90 year old patient went to his local urologist for progressive enlargement of the left hemiscrotal bone, of approximately 2-3 years' evolution, and possible interference with the micturition pattern. The only personal history of the patient was hypertension. Physical examination revealed a very large left hemiscrotal, under tension, with positive transillumination and in which the testicle could not be palpated. The right testicle, which is lateralised due to the size of the left hemiscrotal, and the epididymis were not altered on examination. The patient was in good general condition. In view of these exploratory findings, a Doppler ultrasound was requested, which was reported as a large left hydrocele, heterogeneous left testicle with areas of increased Doppler flow and multiple calcifications, suggesting chronic orchiepididymitis. Right testicle without alterations. It was decided to perform a left orchiectomy via the inguinal route and also to perform surgical treatment of the hydrocele, from which 700 ml were evacuated. The macroscopic appearance of the specimen was reported as a testicle entirely occupied by a tumour measuring 8.7 x 6 cm which does not infiltrate the capsule. The tumour shows solid orange-coloured areas together with haemorrhagic microcystic areas. Macroscopically, the tumour did not appear to reach the epididymal head or the tunica vaginalis. Histologically it was a Leydig cell tumour with malignant criteria (positive for vicentin, focally for CK22 and AEI-AE3 and S-100, negative for PLAP, CD30, CD117, CD45, CD20 and chromogramin). Nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, foci of necrosis, without vascular embolisation. The tumour focally infiltrates the capsule without extending beyond it. Rete testis, epididymis and albuginea are not infiltrated. The extension study with chest X-ray and abdomino-pelvic CT scan was negative. Tumour markers showed normal values. Ten months after the operation, the patient was in good general condition with negative markers and no radiological signs of distant metastasis. The possibility of complementary treatments was ruled out due to the age of the patient and the excellent evolution.   "
"Male patient aged 59 years with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and right lower lobectomy six months ago for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (T2N0M0) at the reference centre, without having received any subsequent treatment. No known allergies or other history of interest. He consulted for clinical manifestations compatible with left renal colic of moderate intensity with ureteral irradiation, without voiding syndrome and accompanied by haematuria with emission of filiform clots. He reported having lost approximately 8 kg in the last 2 months. Examination revealed a slight mucocutaneous pallor, slightly positive left fist percussion. The abdomen was soft and depressible with no masses or megaliths. The rest of the examination was of no interest. Haematological examination showed mild anaemia, with normal biochemistry and coagulation. The urine sediment showed microscopic haematuria. Ultrasound showed a cortical cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 5 cm in size and a solid-cystic tumour of the same size in the lower pole without ectasia of the excretory tract. The right kidney, bladder and prostate were normal. Given the suspicion of a renal mass versus a complex renal cyst, it was decided to perform a thoraco-abdominal-minopelvic CAT scan, which revealed post-surgical changes in the left lung with bilateral emphysema. Retroperitoneal adenopathies in the aorto-caval territory measuring over 1 cm in diameter and a heterogeneous renal mass measuring 5 cm in diameter.  With these findings and the suspicion of renal carcinoma vs. metastasis, it was decided to perform a directed CT FNA, which obtained squamous cells from the left kidney.  With the diagnosis of left renal metastasis of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma (Stage IV), it was decided to refer the patient to the Medical Oncology Department. He started treatment with Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on the first and eighth day of every 21 days, until 3 cycles were completed, and then a response evaluation study was carried out. After receiving 3 cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin-vinorelbine, a discrete growth of the renal mass was observed, so it was considered that there was no response. For this reason she started a second line of chemotherapy with docetaxel 100mg/m2 every 21 days, of which she has received 3 cycles. She is awaiting a CT scan to evaluate the response and, depending on the results, a PET scan has been considered to decide on a possible surgical approach to the renal lesion, if there are no new pathological foci. In any case, the prognosis is the same as for any metastatic pulmonary neoplasm.   "
"This is a 53-year-old man with no past history of interest who was admitted from the emergency department with pulmonary thromboembolism. Given the suspicion of occult neoplasia and the presence of haematuria not previously evident, an abdominal ultrasound scan was carried out which revealed a right renal mass and the study was completed with CT and MRI.  Both studies confirmed the presence of a heterogeneous tumour infiltrating the lower two thirds of the right kidney measuring approximately 10x10 cms. with involvement of the renal sinus and hilum, also showing tumour thrombosis of the right renal vein and infrahepatic cava. No adenopathies or metastases were evident. He underwent an anterior radical nephrectomy with cavotomy to remove the thrombus and an extensive right aorto-caval lymphadenectomy. The anatomo-pathological result was Fuhrman grade 2 clear renal cell carcinoma of 9 cm with invasion of the renal hilum, perinephric fat and renal vein, without metastatic involvement of lymph nodes or the edges of the fat or the hilum, as well as free ureter. (Stage III, T3N0M0). The patient was discharged from hospital on the sixth day. Three months after the operation, the patient reported slight pain and induration in the penis of recent onset. Palpation revealed an indurated mass. An MRI of the pelvis was performed, which revealed the existence of a mass occupying and expanding the left corpus cavernosum, compatible with metastasis of previous renal carcinoma.  A biopsy was taken of the lesion, the result of which confirmed our suspicion, showing isolated nests of tumour cells in the histological sections compatible with metastasis of clear cell carcinoma. Given this diagnosis, we considered the best therapeutic approach for the patient, taking into account the progressive increase in local pain, the patient's age and his good general condition. We therefore opted for a total penectomy until a disease-free surgical border could be confirmed intraoperatively. One week after discharge, the patient was admitted to the oncology department with a picture of obnubilation and motor and sensory alteration, and showed lesions in the cerebellum and right cerebral hemisphere compatible with metastasis in the cranial CT scan. A CT scan of the chest also revealed multiple pulmonary nodules and bilateral paratracheal microadenopathies related to metastasis. The patient died nine months after the first operation for his renal carcinoma, i.e. six months after the diagnosis of metastases in the penis.   "
"An 80-year-old man who presented clinically with haematuria and left flank pain. Fist percussion in the left renal fossa was positive. Imaging techniques revealed a mass in the left renal fossa that blurred the renal silhouette. The patient underwent nephrectomy with proximal ureterectomy. In the nephrectomy specimen, the renal parenchyma was almost entirely replaced by a whitish heterogeneous lesion in which cystic cavities of necrotic appearance with friable and poorly demarcated intracavitary papillary formations and poorly demarcated yellowish areas combined randomly with others of necrotic and/or haemorrhagic appearance could be seen. When cut, a firm consistency was observed, mainly corresponding to the whitish-greyish areas, although in other locations a soft and even crunchy consistency was observed. Histological examination showed a neoplasm consisting of a proliferation of spindle and polygonal cells with marked atypia and nuclear pleomorphism, which adopted a solid growth pattern. More than 75% of it showed differentiation to osteo- and chondrosarcoma although squamous differentiation could also be demonstrated, mainly lining the inner surface of the previously described cystic formations. The high cellular atypia observed was made more evident by the presence of abundant multinucleated giant cells located within the solid spindle-shaped areas and around the areas of osteosarcomatous differentiation (14) (the latter are probably in fact atypical osteoclasts). The tumour contacted the renal capsule without going beyond it, invading vascular structures of the hilum and the adipose tissue of the pelvis. After rigorous sampling of the surgical specimen, few foci with a histological pattern of clear cell carcinoma could be seen. The immunohistochemical study of the neoplasm showed positive immunostaining for cytokeratins in both the clear cell and spindle cell components, the latter also being positive for vimentin (13). Based on the above, the diagnosis of renal sarcomatoid carcinoma with a predominance of areas with malignant heterologous differentiation (osteo- and chondrosarcoma) was made, referring to the presence of foci of carcinoma with a clear cell pattern and areas with squamous differentiation.   "
"A 62 year old patient consulted for pain in the right hemiscroct of three months' evolution. On physical examination, a grade IV right varicocele was found, and a large mass was also palpated at the level of the right renal area. An abdominal ultrasound scan was performed, which revealed a heterogeneous mass of approximately 10 cm in the right kidney and no pathological findings in the left kidney. A computed axial tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast showed a heterogeneous right renal formation measuring 110 x 120 mm in diameter, with no retroperitoneal adenomegaly. Difficult evaluation of the right renal pedicle.  An MRI was requested which confirmed the right renal heterogeneous formation in the upper pole of 12 cm. in diameter, without involvement of the renal vein or the inferior vena cava.  A radical right nephrectomy was performed. Good progress, the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Pathological anatomy revealed: Undifferentiated malignant tumour of lineage to be differentiated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tumour size 13 cm. Local invasion: the tumour extends through the renal capsule, causing focal infiltration of the perisuprarenal fat. Renal hilum free of lesion. Vascular embolisms present, surgical margins free of tumour lesion. Non neoplastic kidney: chronic pyelonephritis. Arterio- and arteriolonephrosclerosis and retention cyst 4 cm. in diameter. Adrenal gland free of lesion. IHQ:WT1 +++,CD 117 +++,CD56 +++,P53 -.  Diagnosis: Nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour), stage II of the NWTS classification. CT scan one month postoperatively showed tumour recurrence at the level of the nephrectomy bed. He started chemotherapy with vincristine, dactinomycin and doxorubicin. During the course of chemotherapy, she developed pneumonia with deterioration of general condition, sepsis and months of nephrectomy.   "
"Male patient, 40 years old, with a medical history. He consulted the urology department for dysuria and 3 episodes of urethrorrhagia. On physical examination the mucous membranes were moist and normal-coloured, cardio-respiratory auscultation was normal, the abdomen was negative, lumbar fossae were free, rectal examination, external genitalia and inguinal regions were normal. Urological ultrasound was normal. Cystourethroscopy was normal, with only a slight protrusion when the cystoscope passed through the anterior urethra. A voiding urethrocystography X-ray showed a filling defect in the anterior urethra.  In view of the above, we decided to carry out an endoscopic study under anaesthesia, detecting a reddish, well-defined polypoid tumour, for which we decided to perform an endoscopic resection. The anatomopathological result of the surgical specimen was an inverted papilloma of the anterior urethra. The patient was discharged due to improvement, evolving satisfactorily with disappearance of dysuria and urethrorrhagia.   "
"A 47-year-old male patient, with no toxic habits or pathological history of interest, came to the andrology clinic for prolonged, non-painful erections of approximately 4 years' duration after blunt perineal trauma with the handlebars of a bicycle. Physical examination revealed enlarged corpora cavernosa, not painful on palpation, with no palpable abnormal pulses. Penile sensitivity was preserved. Mobile testicles in both scrotal pouches without alterations. As complementary explorations, penile Doppler ultrasound was performed: right cavernous vascularisation apparently preserved; in the most proximal portion of the left corpus cavernosum an anechoic formation was observed (2x1.8x1.5cm) with turbulent flow in its interior, compatible with a long-standing arteriovenous fistula (AVF).  With the diagnosis of high flow Priapism, it was decided to perform pudendal arteriography under local anaesthesia confirming AVF and subsequent embolisation of the same by means of 2 coil 3x5.  After embolisation the patient evolves favourably with complete penile detumecence and normal erections. He is currently asymptomatic.   "
"We present the case of a 76-year-old patient, with no known allergies, with a history of dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, old acute myocardial infarction, triple aorto-coronary bypass for 3-vessel disease, one year old, and TUR for leiomyoadenomatous hyperplasia of the prostate, two years old. No previous testicular trauma was reported. He also had no clinical, radiological or laboratory history of tuberculosis or brucellosis. He consulted the urology department for testicular discomfort, consisting of intermittent chronic mild pain, of 4 months' evolution, with a hard and irregular nodule on examination in the right testicle with no accompanying spontaneous pain or pain on palpation. Ultrasound findings revealed a low echogenicity, lobulated, nodular focal lesion 2 cm in diameter in the lower pole of the right testicle, vascularised, and therefore compatible with neoformation. The left testicle had no pathological findings of interest.  Abdominal and pelvic CT scan with contrast shows no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Blood tests showed normal values for alpha-fetoprotein, HCG and LDH (HCG: 1.74 U/l; alpha-fetoprotein: 2.07 ng/ml; LDH: 299 mU/ml). The patient underwent a right inguinal orchiectomy. The macroscopic anatomopathological study showed a scrotal pouch with hydrocele measuring 8 x 5 x 2.5 cm with 5 cm of epididymal duct. The section showed a testicle measuring 5.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm, of fibrous consistency, with no macroscopic lesions compatible with neoplasia. Microscopic examination showed testicular parenchyma with vacuolated degeneration of germ cells and Sertoli cells, with vesicular nuclei, and a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and plasma cells on the walls of the seminiferous tubules. There are numerous granulomatous formations with abundant multinucleated giant cells located in the stroma between the seminiferous tubules and some of them inside the seminiferous tubules. No neoplastic cellularity was observed. PAS and Ziehl Nielsen staining showed no mycotic microorganisms or mycobacteria. Histopathological findings suggest the diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous orchitis.   "
"We present the case of a 61-year-old man diagnosed, operated and treated for rectal adenocarcinoma 18 months previously. He consulted for a painful increase in penile size, together with the appearance of erythematous, excrescent and bleeding lesions on the preputial skin when rubbed. At the same time, hypogastric lymphoedema of the penile skin and scrotum was observed on examination.  The lymphoedema was excised by circumcision. Pathological examination revealed preputial subcutaneous metastases secondary to intestinal adenocarcinoma. The macromicroscopic image showed tumour infiltration of the squamous flat lining epithelium giving rise to a carcinomatous excrescence. There was little inflammatory component. At high magnification, the infiltrating tumour was a moderately differentiated, high-grade adenocarcinoma with a high mitotic index.  Despite oncological treatment, the patient died 4 months after diagnosis.   "
"We present a 63-year-old female patient with a history of arterial hypertension and angor pectoris, referred to our department from a rural hospital. The reason for the consultation was the chance finding of a left renal mass in an ultrasound scan, and the patient did not report any symptoms. Blood tests showed only a slight eosinophilia. As complementary studies, intravenous urographies were performed in which a mass effect was observed at the level of the left flank, with a smooth and well-defined border, depending on the upper pole of the left kidney, with extrinsic compression of the pyelocaliceal system, measuring 16 x 10 cm. CT scan revealed a mass measuring 17 x 12 x 19 cm in the upper pole of the left kidney, with cystic areas, compatible with multilocular cystic nephroma, with no adenopathy. The DMSA scan showed a differential renal function of 63% for the right kidney and 37% for the left kidney.  A new ultrasound scan showed an image compatible with a large hydatid cyst, with structures compatible with vesicles inside. The hydatid serology was negative, so it was decided to submit the patient to an MRI which did not definitively clarify the diagnosis either: mass in the upper pole of the left kidney with a complex internal structure, well delimited, without contrast uptake, with calcifications, suspicious of a renal hydatid cyst or multilocular cystic nephroma. In view of the aforementioned results, the next step was the ultrasound-guided puncture of the renal mass, with negative serology for hydatidosis, although a liquid with a crystalline appearance was obtained. Finally, the patient underwent surgery in which the diagnosis of hydatid cyst was confirmed and a partial cystectomy was performed, preparing the operative field with compresses soaked in rivanol.  Postoperative evolution was favourable, and treatment with albendazole 400 mg every 12 hours for one month after surgery. At the present time, the patient remains asymptomatic (the arterial hypertension she had before diagnosis is maintained) and the control serology was negative again, with minimal eosinophilia persisting.   "
"Male patient, 63 years old, of mixed race, diabetic and inveterate smoker. He presented to the outpatient clinic for pain in the right hypochondrium and low obstructive urinary symptoms consisting of nocturnal frequency of 2-3 times, weak urinary stream and postvoid dribbling. Total PSA was 2µg/mL, haemoglobin, ESR, haemochemistry and cyturia were normal. The general physical examination and abdominal examination were negative. Rectal examination revealed the presence of a slightly enlarged prostate with an irregular surface and a stony consistency. A prostate biopsy was performed, which revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 6 cm diameter, heterogeneous and complex tumour in the lower pole and middle part of the right kidney and another of similar size and ultrasound characteristics in the upper pole and middle portion of the left kidney. A simple and contrasted renal CT scan was performed which confirmed the images reported in the ultrasound, being hypodense, well delimited and both showing enhancement with the administration of iodinated contrast. No abdominal adenopathy or tumour lesions in neighbouring organs were detected. Chest X-ray and bone scintigraphy were negative for metastases.  To establish the diagnosis of renal tumours, laparoscopy was considered, but the patient had a large right supra- and infra-umbilical paramedian scar, sequelae of laparotomy for acute perforated appendicitis with generalised peritonitis, and this procedure was avoided in order to prevent possible complications. It was then decided to perform a fine needle aspiration biopsy on the right kidney lesion and, after two attempts, the samples were not useful for diagnosis. Subsequently, the patient refused to undergo any further investigative or therapeutic procedures for his renal disease. He was treated for prostate cancer with LHRH analogues and anti-androgens. After three months of prostate cancer treatment, the evolving renal CT scan shows no changes from the initial one. The patient is currently asymptomatic and is in good general condition.   "
"This is a 67-year-old patient with a history of depressive syndrome and prostatism, who was diagnosed at the beginning of 2004 with descending colon carcinoma. In March of the same year he underwent a left subtotal colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomosis. The anatomopathological study of the colectomy specimen showed a tumour measuring 4x2 centimetres compatible with a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon, infiltrating down to the subserosal fat, with no lymph node involvement and with free surgical edges (pT3NoMo). Postoperatively, he required drainage of an abscess in the abdominal wall, and the rest of the postoperative period was without further complications. Preoperative blood tests showed a haematocrit of 47.7, haemoglobin of 15.6, creatinine of 0.91, normal urinalysis, PSA < 4 and a Carcino Embryonic Antigen (CEA) of 91.45 (Normal < 5.00). Preoperative CT was reported as a mass in the descending colon compatible with colon carcinoma with small retroperitoneal adenopathies less than 1 centimetre in diameter, not significant, as well as chronic fibrocicatricial lesions in the chest. Four months after the colectomy, the patient began to notice a painful nodular mass in the right testicle. A testicular ultrasound scan was performed which detected a heterogeneous lesion, with solid and cystic areas, at the level of the right epididymal body and which could be affecting the testicle, and the Urology Department was consulted for assessment.  The examination revealed that the patient had a painful tumour measuring 1-2 centimetres in the right epididymis, as well as another smaller tumour in the right spermatic cord. The lesions were scheduled for surgical exploration under spinal anaesthesia with oncological criteria: inguinal incision, extraction of the right teste and spermatic cord and clamping of the same. Macroscopically we observed, in the middle third of the right epididymis, a nodular lesion of about 2 centimetres in diameter, yellowish in colour and elastic in consistency, firmly attached to the right testicle, from which we detached with difficulty. The testicle appeared macroscopically normal and without infiltration. In the right spermatic cord we palpated another lesion of similar characteristics, which appeared to encompass the cord circumferentially. Intraoperative biopsy was performed and reported as adenocarcinoma, so we decided - after informing the patient who gave his consent - to perform a radical right orchiectomy, including the spermatic cord. After studying the surgical specimen, the Pathological Anatomy Service confirmed that it was a tumour measuring 2 centimetres in diameter in the middle third of the right epididymis and another tumour in the right spermatic cord measuring 1.5 centimetres in diameter, corresponding to malignant epithelial neoformations with glandular structures compatible with metastasis of an adenocarcinoma, possibly of the colon. The surgical edges and the right testicle were free of tumour.  The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged by the Urology Department the day after the operation and transferred to the Oncology Department for complementary treatment with chemotherapy. In the postoperative controls, control CT scans and analyses were performed, and 12 weeks after the orchiectomy a significant elevation of the CEA was detected, which corresponded with the appearance in the imaging tests (CT) of retroperitoneal adenopathies larger than 1 centimetre, pulmonary nodules and a thickening of the colon wall near the anastomosis. The patient is currently alive, although the imaging studies carried out after the operation showed that the evolution is unfavourable despite chemotherapy treatment, with the appearance of multiple mesenteric and hepatic implants and an increase in the number and size of the pulmonary nodules.   "
"We present a case with complex lithiasic pathology in which the stone sweeper was used as a bilateral internal urinary diversion. The patient was a 54-year-old male patient with 3 right renal lithiasis, the largest of which was 1.2 cm in the lower calyx, with moderate pyelocaliceal and ureteral dilatation up to the junction with the iliac vessels, where a ureteral lithiasis of 1.1 cm was located; a stone sweeper catheter was placed in this renal unit prior to ESWL treatment. On the left side, a 1 cm lithiasis was found in the lower pole, which had previously been treated with ESWL, achieving partial fragmentation; a stone sweeper catheter was also placed in this renal unit prior to a second ESWL session. The calibre of this catheter is 6.5 Fr and was maintained for a period of one month.  During the two stone sweeper catheters the patient reported no upper or lower urinary tract related symptoms indicating good tolerance. The removal of the catheters was easy, without anaesthesia and small lithiasis fragments were observed inside the baskets.   "
"A 45-year-old woman presented to the urology department with voiding syndrome and recurrent urinary tract infections. The patient had a history of hypothyroidism, arterial hypertension on regular treatment with atenolol and enalapril, smoked 10 cigarettes a day and had undergone cholecystectomy. Physical examination revealed no pathological findings. Renal and bladder ultrasound was performed, showing irregular thickening of the bladder wall.  Cystoscopy was subsequently performed and revealed a small bladder with a neoformation of approximately 5 centimetres in diameter with a solid appearance on the left lateral side towards the back and anterior side, with an inflammatory appearance and poorly defined limits. In the abdomino-pelvic CT scan, a diffuse thickening of the bladder wall was observed, which was more significant on the left side. After contrast administration, diffuse uptake of the entire bladder wall was observed with marked enhancement of the left parietal mucosa. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenomegaly was observed. Urine cytology was negative on two occasions for tumour cells.  In view of these findings, transurethral resection of the bladder neoformation and random bladder biopsies were performed. The samples obtained were sent for anatomo-pathological analysis, which showed diffuse proliferation of spindle-shaped and elongated cells at the level of the lamina propria, with large vascular neoformation; nodular structures consisting of an acellular eosinophilic material whose fibres are arranged in a swirling manner, constituting Wagner-Meissner bodies, in a concentric arrangement simulating nerve structures, were also observed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the spindle cells and Wagner-Meissner bodies were strongly positive for antiserum S-100, confirming the diagnosis of diffuse neurofibromatosis of the bladder wall. The patient was referred to the internal medicine department for further investigation to rule out other manifestations of neurofibromatosis in other organs. In the same way, the patient is periodically followed up by the urology department to monitor the appearance of new neoformations.   "
"A 26 year old patient was referred from the outpatient department of the digestive service to assess some lesions that had recently appeared on the preputial skin. His family history includes Crohn's disease in a twin brother; his personal history includes Crohn's disease diagnosed six years earlier, which has presented with severe outbreaks during these years and has required treatment with corticoids and immunosuppressants. In one of these flare-ups, surgery was necessary, in which a total colectomy and ileostomy were performed according to the Brooke technique. The immediate postoperative course was satisfactory. In the months following the operation, he developed severe granulomatous rectitis, treated with deflazacort and mesalazine rectal enemas. The patient is also being studied by the haematology department for persistently prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). He was referred to us from the Digestive outpatient clinic for presenting a lesion on the preputial skin that had been present for a year and a half, in the form of an erythematous, ulcerated plaque. It had been treated with topical corticosteroids with the diagnosis of suspected pyoderma gangrenosum, but had not progressed satisfactorily. In addition, the patient reported itching and some suppuration, so a sample was taken for culture, which showed growth of urethral colonising flora with no pathological significance. It was decided to perform a circumcision, sending the preputial skin to the pathological anatomy service with the following result: non-caseating granuloma, with ulceration, typical of metastatic Crohn's disease.  After excision of the lesion, no recurrence was observed after one year of follow-up.   "
"This is a 73 year old female patient who came for gynaecological consultation due to metrorrhagia. On examination, no gynaecological pathology was observed and she was referred to the urology department for examination. The patient has a personal history of previous hysterectomy 20 years ago for leiomyomas, and has been consulting a urologist for four years due to pain, haematuria and repeated urinary tract infections, having undergone a urological examination in the first consultations, which included cystoscopy with multiple biopsy with the anatomopathological result of inflammation and urothelial dysplasia. Subsequently, she underwent periodic check-ups, including cytology and control cystoscopies with cold biopsy, with no evidence of neoplasia. When she was referred by the gynaecology department, an ultrasound study was performed in which a hypoechoic image was observed adjacent to the bladder, and a CT scan was recommended. The pelvic CT scan showed an oval tumour, with well-defined contours, soft tissue density, slightly heterogeneous, with a maximum diameter of about 5 cm, located adjacent to the left anterior margin of the bladder without communication with the bladder lumen, presenting poorly defined margins with apparent infiltration of the perivesical fat, and which on the anterior and inferior margin presents a linear image of soft tissue density that appears to contact the abdominal wall.  With the diagnosis of a prevesical mass suspicious of a desmoid cyst or persistent urachal tumour, surgery was performed. A median laparotomy incision was performed with resection of the prevesical neoplastic process associated with partial cystectomy. Macroscopic examination of the specimen revealed an oval formation of elastic consistency measuring 8x4 cm, which, when cut, appeared to correspond to a cystic formation filled with greyish, friable material. Microscopic examination shows that the wall of the cavity is made up of fibromuscular tissue and from it a grade III papillary neoplasm of transitional epithelium can be observed, which presents a fundamentally exophytic growth towards the lumen of the duct, without infiltrating the whole of the wall. The tumour infiltrates the muscular wall of the bladder, included in one of the resection ends, without reaching the mucosa, and no urothelial neoplasia is observed in the bladder lining epithelium.  The patient was discharged from hospital and remains asymptomatic at the present time.   "
"An 81-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with asthenia, anorexia and right lumbar pain of 2 weeks' duration. Haemodynamically stable, and with fever (38.5 degrees) for 3 days. With a history of heart failure associated with atrial fibrillation, with no history of urological diseases. Physical examination revealed pain on deep palpation located in the right hemiabdomen, with no signs of peritoneal irritation, with the presence of a palpable mass and positive renal Murphy on the right. Analyses showed leukocytosis (22,390 with left shift), normochromic normocytic anaemia, with renal function within normal parameters, leukocyturia and microscopic haematuria. Reno-vesical radiography showed multiple radiopaque stones located in the right kidney. Abdominal-pelvic computed axial tomography with intravenous contrast injection showed an enlarged right kidney, with cortico-medullary disorganisation and the presence of multiple large lithiasic formations located in the renal pelvis.  With the diagnosis of pyonephrosis and to stabilise the general deterioration, we decided to perform a pecutaneous nephrostomy at first. We witnessed abundant purulent fluid coming out of the nephrostomy, the culture of which revealed polymicrobial flora. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started. After four days and as the surgical conditions were more suitable, we decided to perform a right nephrectomy by lombotomy. The description of the surgical specimen is as follows: Kidney (13x8.5x5 cm) sent with ureteral segment 10 cm long and with presence of perirenal adipose tissue. There is dilatation of the pyelocaliceal tree and marked atrophy of the renal parenchyma. Inside the pyelic tree there is purulent content and stones are identified, the largest of which is 4.5 cm. There are foci of suppuration with abcedification of the renal parenchyma and perirenal adipose tissue. In the pelvis and adjacent calyxes there is white tissue with a soft consistency measuring 6x5 cm, 10 cm away from the ureteral surgical top. Histological examination showed adenocarcinoma with predominant areas of tubular pattern and focal areas of tubulovillous pattern.  The neoplasm presents characteristics of intestinal type adenocarcinoma, being possible to identify intestinal type Goblet cells characterised by the presence of apical intracytoplasmic mucus vacuoles.... The nuclei in some areas are uniform and monotonous and in other areas are more aggressive, irregular, of different sizes and with frequent mitotic activity. The neoplasm invades the subepithelial connective tissue. Glandular metaplasia of the urothelial epithelium is identified in the lining of the pyelocaliceal tree. Six months after surgery the patient died.   "
"A 39-year-old black male patient aged 39 years with a history of recurrent oral aphthous lesions and vision disorders (progressive loss), who presented with painful ulcerative lesions in the genital region (penis and scrotum), with a diameter of 3 and 10 mm, with trimmed edges and a yellowish background, covered with a pseudomembrane. We carried out complementary tests, thinking that it was a sexually transmitted disease, but everything was within normal limits. We then decided to perform excision and biopsy of the lesions. The results showed a leukocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis, epidermal necrosis and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (no tumour lesion).  When she returned to the clinic, she presented with total loss of vision and arthralgias. The case is discussed in conjunction with Urology, Dermatology and Ophthalmology, and the criteria are as follows: - Recurrent oral aphthosis. - Signs of uveitis (loss of vision). - Genital ulcers. And performing the cutaneous patergia test, which consists of injecting 1 cc of physiological saline solution intradermally into the patient's forearm. Where it was considered 'positive' (he developed a pustule on an erythematous base), we concluded that this patient had Behcet's disease.   "
"Infant, Caucasian, the first child of young, healthy, non-consanguineous parents (mother aged 28 and father aged 30), with no history of hereditary-familial pathology, renal or known hypertension. Gestation correctly monitored and without alterations. Euthocic birth at 37 weeks without complications, presenting an Apgar test of 9/10. Anthropometry at birth, weight 2,760 grams, with a cephalo-caudal diameter of 48.5 cm and head circumference of 34.7 cm. VDRL, AntHBs, HIV negative, non-immune Toxoplasmosis and immune rubella. Bilateral auricular appendages, low implantation of the pinna, cutaneous granulomas, micrognathism with mandibular hypoplasia, coloboma located in the left eye and solid scrotal tumefaction apparently not painful on palpation. Vaccination schedule up to date.  The infant was transferred from another hospital at 19 days of life with a diagnosis of urosepsis. He was initially admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to stabilise the condition by means of support measures and antibiotic therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin and cefotaxime. Reno-pelvic-scrotal ultrasound revealed bilateral uretero-hydronephrosis and thick-walled bladder, right scrotal swelling, with apparent hypo- and hyperechogenic images with septa and apparent testicular destruction. Once the parameters were stabilised and with negative uroculture, we performed a serial voiding cystourethrogram showing dilatation of the posterior urethra, trabeculated bladder and no presence of vesico-ureteral reflux, suspecting posterior urethral valve disease.  Whole body bone radiographs did not detect bone alterations or vertebral alterations. We performed fulguration of the posterior urethral valves and right inguinal orchidectomy. The postoperative period passed without complications. The catheter was removed on the seventh postoperative day. He was discharged with normal renal function, negative uroculture and correct diuresis. At the fourth month of life he was hospitalised with a diagnosis of respiratory infection in the context of bronchiolitis, with positive urocultures for polymicrobial flora, he was medicated with antibiotherapy and discharged with antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sufamethoxazole. At the fifth month with aseptic urine, we performed endovenous urography and renal cintilogram with MAG-3 and furosemide test, showing bilateral ureteral dilatation, right renal bifidity, with normal bladder capacity and complete emptying of the bladder, urethra apparently without alterations, bilateral renal function is preserved, responding to the furosemide test. We reached the diagnosis of bilateral non-obstructive ureteral dilatations associated with pyelic bifidity. We decided to carry out check-ups every 6 months. In the last control the 15 month old child showed normal renal function, good diuresis and urinary sediments without alterations.   "
"We present the case of a 70-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension, hiatus hernia, constipation and hysterectomy who consulted for irritative voiding syndrome for 8 months, consisting of intense dysuria and pollakiuria with occasional urinary urges without other urological symptoms. In the last 6 months she had presented 3 episodes of lower urinary tract infection with positive urine cultures for E. coli treated by her general practitioner. Initial work-up included blood biochemistry which was normal, urine and urine sediment study which showed intense leukocyturia, urine culture which was again positive for E.coli and urine cytology by spontaneous urination which showed urothelial cells without atypia and abundant neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Treatment was prescribed with antibioteparia and anticholinergic (tolterodine). After 3 months, the patient was reviewed in the outpatient clinic, with persistent symptoms based on dysuria and pollakiuria, although she had improved considerably from the emergencies with the anticholinergic drug, and even days before the review she had had a new episode of urinary tract infection. Given the poor response, a more advanced study was initiated, requesting intravenous urography to rule out a urothelial tumour of the upper urinary tract, which was strictly normal, and urological ultrasound, which was also normal, so cystoscopy was performed in consultation, finding nodular lesions, raised, solid in appearance, slightly reddened, with adjacent areas of oedema, located in the trigone and lower part of both lateral sides. Due to this finding, despite the fact that the patient had no risk factors for TB and the urography was strictly normal, urine smear microscopy and Lowenstein-Jensen culture of 6 samples of the first morning urine on consecutive days were performed, as the bladder lesions macroscopically could be tuberculomas, and these studies were negative for Koch's bacillus, so endoscopic resection of the lesions described was performed under anaesthesia. The anatomopathological study revealed ulceration of the mucosa with significant chronic inflammatory infiltrate and vascular congestion, as well as the presence of plasma cells and lymphocytes constituting lymphoid follicles, These are divided into a central zone with abundant lymphoblasts and immunoblasts, called the clear germinative centre, and a peripheral zone formed by mature cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells) giving rise to mantle lymphocytes or corona radiata, as they are also called.  The patient was prescribed hygienic-dietary measures and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis with a single daily nocturnal dose for 3 months and then every other day for 6 months with ciprofloxacin, vitamin A in a single daily dose for 6 months, prednisone 30mg for 45 days and then every other day for another 45 days until its definitive suspension, and finally digestive protection with omeprazole. The patient experienced clear improvement with progressive disappearance of the symptoms, especially after the third month of treatment. Currently (one year after the end of treatment), she is asymptomatic with normal control cystoscopy and negative urine cultures.   "
"A 41-year-old smoker diagnosed with lipoma on the right thigh underwent an abdominal ultrasound scan following an elevation of catecholamines in the blood (noradrenaline and dopamine) without accompanying hypertension. A hypoanechoic nodular lesion of approximately 3 cm in maximum dimension compatible with a solid lesion with cystic degeneration, multitabic, was observed at the adrenal level. The lesion was confirmed by CT scan and scintigraphy. The patient underwent surgery with the clinical findings of pheochromocytoma versus adrenal gland adenoma. A 9 cm irregular adipose tissue fragment was received with serial sections showing a 1.2 cm yellowish-orange tissue together with a thin-walled, whitish multilocular cystic formation with no papillary formations or outgrowths inside. Histological examination showed a large cystic formation without haematic content lined by flat cells with central spindle-shaped nuclei sometimes protruding intraluminally, with immunohistochemical positivity for CD 31 and CD 34 and negativity for calrretinin (endothelium). Cystic formations with similar characteristics to the one described, although smaller in size, were observed both adjacent to the main formation and randomly distributed within the adrenal parenchyma. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma was made.   "
"Patient aged 86 years, retired construction worker, with no previous medical or surgical history, who consulted for occasional episodes of dizziness. Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse rate of 92 per minute, blood pressure of 110 / 80, normal cardio-pulmonary examination and a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 26. Abdominal examination revealed a painless mass in the right flank, which moved with respiratory movements. Preoperative evaluation shows an electrocardiogram with a complete arrhythmia due to atrial fibrillation, normal haemogram with a sedimentation rate of 36 mm/hr, Creatinine of 1.03 mg/dl, normal albumin and total protein, and normal liver function. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a multilocular cystic mass 12 cm in diameter in the lower pole of the right kidney.  With the diagnosis of a right renal tumour, the risks of surgery were discussed with the patient and family, who agreed to the procedure. Three weeks after diagnosis, a laparoscopic hand-assisted radical nephrectomy was performed, indicated by the size of the tumour mass. The surgical procedure was performed with the placement of 4 trocars. Two 10 mm trocars, one right subcostal and one right pararectal at the level of the umbilicus, the latter for insertion of the camera. Two 5 mm trocars are also placed in the epigastrium to separate the liver. The surgeon's hand is introduced through an oblique incision in the right iliac fossa. Radical nephrectomy is performed in the usual way preserving the adrenal gland. The kidney is placed in a polyethylene bag and removed through the iliac fossa incision.  Surgical time was 100 minutes, with estimated bleeding of less than 100 ml. There were no intraoperative or postoperative haemodynamic alterations.  The immediate postoperative period evolved without complications, requiring non-steroidal analgesics (Ketorolac) for pain control. Medical discharge was indicated 36 hours after surgery. In the outpatient control 9 days after surgery the patient was asymptomatic and his tests showed a haemoglobin of 13.7 mg/dl, creatinine of 1.74 mg/dl and urea nitrogen of 23.0 mg/dl. The biopsy was reported as kidney and perirenal adipose tissue which together weighed 1,400 g. Towards the lower pole and in intimate contact with the kidney there was a 9.5 cm tumour, firm in consistency, which on section showed extensive cystic areas, yellow-orange, softened, necrotic, with haemorrhagic content and which did not penetrate the renal capsule. On the periphery of the tumour there were well-defined, pale yellow, adipose-like tumour areas, which together constituted a tumour measuring 15 cm in diameter and which were in close contact with the surgical section, separated from it by a thin sheet of fibrous tissue 0.1 cm thick.  On histological examination the renal parenchyma showed preserved architecture. The central tumoural portion showed a hypercellular neoplastic proliferation of spindle-shaped, stellate, epitheloid cells, some giant, with scanty, poorly demarcated cytoplasm, irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli and high mitotic rate; the cells were arranged in sheets amidst a moderately abundant myxoid stroma in some areas with G3 myxofibrosarcoma (myxoid variant malignant fibrohistiocytoma). In the peripheral portions, the tumour had a clearly better differentiated adipose appearance with G1-2 myxoliposarcoma features. The adipose tumour was separated from the surgical section by a thin sheet of fibrous tissue 1 mm thick. The pathology report concluded that it was a perirenal myxoliposarcoma with indifferentiation towards a G3 myxofibrosarcoma (malignant fibrohistiocytoma myxoid variant). The patient is currently asymptomatic and with stable renal function 9 months after surgery.   "
"A 52 year old patient with a personal history of terminal renal failure of an unaffiliated aetiology who received a heterotopic transplant in FID from a cadaveric donor in January 1999. He had previously required haemodialysis from 1980 to 1983, and peritoneal dialysis from then until the time of renal transplantation. There were no post-transplant complications. The patient was given triple immunosuppressive therapy with Cyclosporine, Prednisone and Mycophenolate, presenting immediate diuresis with progressive improvement of renal function, with creatininemia at discharge being 1.8 mg/dl. After an uncomplicated and asymptomatic post-transplant period of 51 months in which he maintained stable renal function (creatininemia: 1.2-1.4 mg/dl), a 1.5 cm vascularised solid nodule was observed in the lower pole of the renal graft in a control ultrasound scan. Subsequent ultrasound-guided FNA revealed RCC.  In June 2003, by reopening the previous Gibson incision in FID, and after freeing the renal graft from the surrounding adhesions, a 1.5 cm well circumscribed exophytic tumour was identified in its lower pole-anterior aspect. Lumpectomy was performed with a margin of more than 0.5 cm of macroscopically healthy parenchyma, and samples of the base were sent intraoperatively and reported to be free of tumour involvement. For haemostatic purposes, intraparenchymal stitches of the bleeding vessels and 'mattress' approach stitches supported by Goretex and Surgicel were performed.  The definitive histopathological diagnosis was Fuhrman type I papillary renal carcinoma, Fuhrman grade 2, UICC stage I (pT1a, Nx, Mx) with resection margins and peritumoural fat without tumour involvement. There were no complications in the postoperative course of the lumpectomy, and immunosuppressive therapy was not modified. In the almost three-year follow-up, carried out initially quarterly and subsequently every six months, by means of a renal function study and ultrasound or MRI, there is no evidence of tumour recurrence to date, maintaining adequate renal function with creatininemia of 1.18 mg/dl, and creatinine clearance of 115.5 ml/min without proteinuria.

"We present the clinical case of a 28 year old male, with no personal history of interest, who came for consultation because he had been presenting for about 10 days with an indurated area on the penis close to the balanopreputial sulcus with the only associated symptomatology being discomfort during erections in the last few days. In the anamnesis, the only interesting fact was the increase in sexual activity in the days preceding the appearance of the lesion, without these relations having been with a risky partner or having received any trauma to the area in question. She did not report any micturition symptoms or fever. Physical examination revealed a subcutaneous indurated cord, about 2 cm long, close to the balanopreputial sulcus, mobile, non-painful and with no associated changes in the penile skin or signs of inflammation. There were also no palpable inguinal adenopathies. Among the complementary tests, a urine and sediment study, urine culture, culture of prostatic secretion and post-prostate massage urine were requested, all of which were strictly normal, as well as serology tests for venereal diseases, which were negative. An expectant attitude was maintained and sexual abstinence was recommended, with spontaneous remission after 4 weeks.   "
"11-year-old white girl with a history of previous health problems. She was admitted when her parents noticed an increase in abdominal volume for approximately 12 days, accompanied by weight loss and lack of appetite. On physical examination, the mucous membranes are pale, and there is a palpable tumour of 8-10cm in the right abdominal flank, with defined borders, firm and non-painful consistency, which passes the abdominal midline. Routine tests show a haemoglobin of 90mg/lt and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 130mm/1 hour. Chest X-ray is normal, as is the bone survey, simple abdominal X-ray shows calcifications in the tumour, IVUS shows normal sized kidneys, good bilateral renal elimination, no dilatation of the excretory tract, In the IVUS the kidneys are of normal size, good bilateral renal elimination, no dilatation of the excretory tract, only slight displacement of the right kidney downwards and outwards due to the tumour and in the ultrasound scan a solid, echogenic mass of 11cm in diameter, located in the right abdominal flank above and towards the lower pole of the right kidney, but without infiltrating it, is observed. Surgical treatment was decided with the preoperative diagnosis of Neuroblastoma, after blood replacement by transfusion. During the operation, several tumours were observed in the meso of the transverse colon, the largest measuring 7cm, which were resected and removed in their entirety. Macroscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed whitish tumours with apparently good delimitation, a firm consistency and a whirling appearance, with focal calcifications. Microscopic study showed that the intestinal tumour was made up of a proliferation of fibroblastic cells, with characteristics in some areas similar to smooth muscle cells, foci of calcification and necrosis, and the histopathological diagnosis was myofibromatosis.

"Patient aged 19 years, with no past history of interest, who consulted for a slightly painful tumour in the right testicle, of about 8 months' evolution, with a clinical examination showing testicular enlargement with nodular areas. The left testicle showed no alterations. Alpha-Feto-Protein: 38.2 and Beta-HGC of 1.48. Ultrasonographically, three independent and well-defined tumour nodules were observed: two of them were heterogeneous, solid, 20 and 33 mm in diameter, with cystic areas and calcifications. The third nodule was solid, hypoechoic and homogeneous, 26 mm in diameter. All nodules showed increased vascularisation with low resistance arterial flows. The extension study was negative. Orchiectomy was performed. Histologically the first two nodules corresponded to teratocarcinomas (mature teratoma and predominant embryonal carcinoma), being macroscopically brownish-white masses, with cavities of yellowish serous content, calcifications and foci of necrosis. The third was diagnosed as classic seminoma, being macroscopically more homogeneous.   "
"A 67-year-old male patient, with no past history of interest, attended urology for the first time, referred by his primary care doctor, due to symptoms of prostatism. Physical examination revealed a prostate of adenomatous consistency and increased size (III/IV). Transrectal ultrasound showed heterogeneous parenchyma, with isolated calcifications in the right lobe, without hypoechoic images and with a prostate volume of 101.7 c.c. In the analyses, elevated PSA (13.08 ng/ml.). A transrectal prostate biopsy was indicated. The result of the pathological anatomy was reported as prostatic blue nevus. It describes a prostatic parenchyma with chronic inflammation and granulomatous foreign body type reaction, with the presence of intracytoplasmic granules and dendritic spindle-shaped melanocytes. There is no evidence of malignancy in any of the samples.   "
"Patient aged 27 years with no allergies or history of interest. She came from the gynaecology department where an ultrasound scan showed a neoformative image in the right retrotrigonal area. She had no associated urological symptoms. Intravenous urography confirmed the ultrasound finding of a repletion defect in the right lateral area, as well as the C.A.T. study.  Cystoscopy showed a raised area with no mucosal alteration at that level. Transurethral resection was performed, confirming the finding of bladder leiomyoma.  The postoperative evolution was satisfactory, as was the follow-up in outpatient clinics with annual endoscopic studies.  "
